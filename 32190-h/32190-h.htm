<h2>CATALOGUE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Of Pope's Collected Editions of his Works.</span></h3>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The Works of Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander Pope</span>. London: Printed by <span class="smcap">W.
Bowyer</span> for <span class="smcap">Bernard Lintot</span>, between the Temple Gates, 1717.
4to and folio.</p></div>

<p>This volume consists of all the acknowledged poems which Pope had
hitherto published, with the addition of some new pieces.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The Works of Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander Pope</span>. Volume ii. London: Printed
by <span class="smcap">J. Wright</span>, for <span class="smcap">Lawton Gilliver</span>, at Homer's Head in Fleet
Street, 1735. 4to and folio.</p></div>

<p>The volume of 1735 contains, with a few exceptions, the poems which Pope
had printed since 1717. The pages of each group of pieces&mdash;Epistles,
Satires, Epitaphs, etc.&mdash;are numbered separately, and there are other
irregularities in the numbers, arising from a change in the order of the
Moral Essays after the sheets were struck off.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Letters of Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander Pope</span>, and Several of his friends.
London: Printed by <span class="smcap">J. Wright</span> for <span class="smcap">J. Knapton</span> in Ludgate
Street, <span class="smcap">L. Gilliver</span> in Fleet Street, <span class="smcap">J. Brindley</span> in New Bond
Street, and <span class="smcap">R. Dodsley</span> in Pall-Mall, 1737. 4to and folio.</p></div>


<p>This is Pope's first avowed edition of his letters. A half-title, "The
Works of Mr. Alexander Pope in Prose," precedes the title-page.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The Works of Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander Pope</span>, in Prose. Vol. ii. London:
Printed for J. and <span class="smcap">P. Knapton, C. Bathurst</span>, and <span class="smcap">R. Dodsley</span>,
1741. 4to and folio.</p></div>

<p>The half-title is more precise: "The Works of Mr. Alexander Pope, in
Prose. Vol. ii. Containing the rest of his Letters, with the Memoirs of
Scriblerus, never before printed; and other Tracts written either
singly, or in conjunction with his friends. Now first collected
together." The letters are the Swift correspondence, and they are in a
different type from the rest of the book. The numbers of the pages are
very irregular, and show that the contents and arrangement of the volume
had been greatly altered from some previous impression. The folio copies
of the two volumes of poetry, and the two of prose, are merely the
quarto text portioned out into longer pages, without a single leaf being
reprinted. The trifling variations from the quartos were introduced when
the matter was put into the folio size.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The Works of <span class="smcap">Alexander Pope, Esq.</span>; vol. i. with explanatory
Notes and Additions never before printed. London: Printed
for <span class="smcap">B. Lintot</span>, 1736. Small 8vo.</p></div>

<p>This is the first volume of an edition which extended to nine volumes,
and which from the want of uniformity in the title-pages, the dates, and
names of the publishers appears to consist of odd volumes. The copyright
of Pope's works belonged to different proprietors, and they at last
agreed to print their respective shares in small octavo, that the
several parts united might form a complete set. Each proprietor
commenced printing his particular section of the octavos when the
previous sizes he had on hand were sold, and thus it happened that the
second volume of the edition came out in 1735 before the first, which
was published in 1736. The series was not finished till 1742, when the
fourth book of the Dunciad was added to the Poems, and the Swift
Correspondence to the Letters. Some of the volumes were reprinted, and
the later editions occasionally differ slightly from their predecessors.
The Poems and Letters of Pope are more complete in the octavos than in
the quartos, but the octavos, on the other hand, omit all the prose
works except the Letters, and the Memoirs of Scriblerus, and octavos and
quartos combined are imperfect in comparison with the editions which
have been published since Pope's death.</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT OF WARBURTON TO HIS EDITION OF POPE'S WORKS, 1751.</h2>


<p>Mr. Pope, in his last illness, amused himself, amidst the care of his
higher concerns, in preparing a corrected and complete edition of his
writings;<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and, with his usual delicacy, was even solicitous to
prevent any share of the offence they might occasion, from falling on
the friend whom he had engaged to give them to the public.<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In
discharge of this trust, the public has here a complete edition of his
works, executed in such a manner, as, I am persuaded, would have been to
his satisfaction. The editor hath not, for the sake of profit, suffered
the author's name to be made cheap by a subscription;<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> nor his works
to be defrauded of their due honours by a vulgar or inelegant
impression; nor his memory to be disgraced by any pieces unworthy of his
talents or virtue. On the contrary, he hath, at a very great expense,
ornamented this edition with all the advantages which the best artists
in paper, printing, and sculpture could bestow upon it.<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>If the public hath waited longer than the deference due to its generous
impatience for the author's writings should have suffered, it was owing
to a reason which the editor need not be ashamed to tell. It was his
regard to the family interests of his deceased friend. Mr. Pope, at his
death, had left large impressions of several parts of his works, unsold,
the property of which was adjudged to belong to his executors; and the
editor was willing they should have time to dispose of them to the best
advantage, before the publication of this edition (which hath been long
prepared) should put a stop to the sale. But it may be proper to be a
little more particular concerning the superiority of this edition above
all the preceding, so far as Mr. Pope himself was concerned. What the
editor hath done, the reader must collect for himself.</p>

<p>The first volume, and the original poems in the second, are here first
printed from a copy corrected throughout by the author himself, even to
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> very preface,<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which, with several additional notes in his own
hand, he delivered to the editor a little before his death. The juvenile
translations, in the other part of the second volume, it was never his
intention to bring into this edition of his works, on account of the
levity of some, the freedom of others, and the little importance of all.
But these being the property of other men, the editor had it not in his
power to follow the author's intention.</p>

<p>The third volume (all but the Essay on Man, which together with the
Essay on Criticism, the author, a little before his death, had corrected
and published in quarto, as a specimen of his projected edition,) was
printed by him in his last illness, but never published, in the manner
it is now given. The disposition of the Epistle on the Characters of Men
is quite altered; that on the Characters of Women much enlarged; and the
Epistles on Riches and Taste corrected and improved. To these advantages
of the third volume must be added a great number of fine verses, taken
from the author's manuscript copies of these poems, communicated by him
for this purpose to the editor. These, the author, when he first
published the poems to which they belong, thought proper, for various
reasons, to omit. Some, from the manuscript copy of the Essay on Man,
which tended to discredit fate, and to recommend the moral government of
God, had, by the editor's advice, been restored to their places in the
last edition of that poem.<a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The rest, together with others of the like
sort, from his manuscript copy of the other Ethic Epistles, are here
inserted at the bottom of the page, under the title of Variations.</p>

<p>The fourth volume contains the Satires, with their Prologue,&mdash;the
Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot; and Epilogue,&mdash;the two poems intitled
<span class="smcap">mdccxxxviii</span>. The Prologue and Epilogue are here given with the like
advantages as the Ethic Epistles in the foregoing volume, that is to
say, with the Variations, or additional verses from the author's
manuscripts. The Epilogue to the Satires is likewise inriched with many
and large notes, now first printed from the author's own manuscript.</p>

<p>The fifth volume contains a correcter and completer edition of the
Dunciad than hath been hitherto published, of which, at present, I have
only this further to add, that it was at my request he laid the plan of
a fourth book. I often told him, it was pity so fine a poem should
remain disgraced by the meanness of its subject, the most insignificant
of all dunces,&mdash;bad rhymers and malevolent cavillers; that he ought to
raise and ennoble it by pointing his satire against the most pernicious
of all,&mdash;minute philosophers and free-thinkers. I imagined, too, it was
for the interests of religion to have it known, that so great a genius
had a due abhorrence of these pests of virtue and society. He came
readily into my opinion; but, at the same time, told me it would create
him many enemies. He was not mistaken, for though the terror of his pen
kept them for some time in respect, yet on his death they rose with
unrestrained fury in numerous coffee-house tales, and Grub Street
libels. The plan of this admirable satire was artfully contrived to
show, that the follies and defects of a fashionable education naturally
led to, and necessarily ended in, freethinking, with design to point out
the only remedy adequate to so destructive an evil. It was to advance
the same ends of virtue and religion, that the editor prevailed on him
to alter everything in his moral writings that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> might be suspected of
having the least glance towards fate or naturalism, and to add what was
proper to convince the world that he was warmly on the side of moral
government and a revealed will. And it would be great injustice to his
memory not to declare that he embraced these occasions with the most
unfeigned pleasure.</p>

<p>The sixth volume consists of Mr. Pope's miscellaneous pieces in verse
and prose. Amongst the verse several fine poems make now their first
appearance in his works. And of the prose, all that is good, and nothing
but what is exquisitely so, will be found in this edition.</p>

<p>The seventh, eighth, and ninth volumes consist entirely of his letters,
the more valuable, as they are the only true models which we, or perhaps
any of our neighbours, have of familiar epistles.<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This collection is
now made more complete by the addition of several new pieces. Yet,
excepting a short explanatory letter to Col. M[oyser], and the letters
to Mr. A[llen] and Mr. W[arburton] (the latter of which are given to
show the editor's inducements, and the engagements he was under, to
intend the care of this edition) excepting these, I say, the rest are
all here published from the author's own printed, though not published
copies delivered to the editor.<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, the advantages of this edition, above the preceding, are
these,&mdash;that it is the first complete collection which has ever been
made of his original writings; that all his principal poems, of early or
later date, are here given to the public with his last corrections and
improvements; that a great number of his verses are here first printed
from the manuscript copies of his principal poems of later date; that
many new notes of the author are here added to his poems; and lastly,
that several pieces, both in prose and verse make now their first
appearance before the public.</p>

<p>The author's life deserves a just volume, and the editor intends to give
it. For to have been one of the first poets in the world is but his
second praise. He was in a higher class. He was one of the "noblest
works of God." He was an "honest man,"<a name="FNanchor_9_11" id="FNanchor_9_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_11" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;a man who alone possessed
more real virtue than, in very corrupt times, needing a satirist like
him, will sometimes fall to the share of multitudes. In this history of
his life,<a name="FNanchor_10_12" id="FNanchor_10_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_12" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> will be contained a large account of his writings, a
critique on the nature, force, and extent of his genius, exemplified
from these writings; and a vindication of his moral character,
exemplified by his more distinguished virtues,&mdash;his filial piety, his
disinterested friendships, his reverence for the constitution of his
country, his love and admiration of virtue, and (what was the necessary
effect) his hatred and contempt of vice, his extensive charity to the
indigent, his warm benevolence to mankind, his supreme veneration of the
Deity, and above all his sincere belief of Revelation. Nor shall his
faults be concealed. It is not for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> the interests of his virtues that
they should. Nor indeed could they be concealed, if we were so disposed,
for they shine through his virtues, no man being more a dupe to the
specious appearances of virtue in others.<a name="FNanchor_11_13" id="FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_13" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In a word, I mean not to
be his panegyrist but his historian. And may I, when envy and calumny
have taken the same advantage of my absence (for, while I live, I will
freely trust it to my life to confute them) may I find a friend as
careful of my honest fame as I have been of his! Together with his
works, he hath bequeathed me his dunces. So that as the property is
transferred, I could wish they would now let his memory alone. The veil
which death draws over the good is so sacred, that to tear it, and with
sacrilegious hands, to throw dirt upon the shrine, gives scandal even to
barbarians. And though Rome permitted her slaves to calumniate her best
citizens on the day of triumph, yet the same petulancy at their funeral
would have been rewarded with execration and a gibbet.<a name="FNanchor_12_14" id="FNanchor_12_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_14" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The public
may be malicious; but is rarely vindictive or ungenerous. It would abhor
all insults, on a writer dead, though it had borne with the ribaldry, or
even set the ribalds on work, when he was alive. And in this there is no
great harm, for he must have a strange impotency of mind indeed whom
such miserable scribblers can disturb or ruffle. Of all that gross
Beotian phalanx who have written scurrilously against the editor, he
knows not so much as one whom a writer of reputation would not wish to
have his enemy, or whom a man of honour would not be ashamed to own for
his friend.<a name="FNanchor_13_15" id="FNanchor_13_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_15" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He is indeed but slightly conversant in their works, and
knows little of the particulars of their defamation. To his authorship
they are heartily welcome. But if any of them have been so far abandoned
by truth as to attack his moral character in any respect whatsoever, to
all and every one of these and their abettors, he gives the lie in form,
and in the words of honest Father Valerian, <i>mentiris impudentissime</i>.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>In his will, dated December 12, 1743, not quite six months before he
died, Pope bequeathed his printed works to Warburton, on condition that
he published them without "future alterations." Warburton states that
the object of the proviso was to relieve him from the obloquy he might
incur by reproducing offensive strokes of satire. A few slight
alterations which had not the sanction of any prior edition were
nevertheless introduced by Warburton into some of the poems, and he
announced on the title-page and in the preface, that they were taken
from a corrected copy delivered to him by Pope. Mr. Croker mistrusted
the genuineness of the "alterations," and he intended to reject the text
of Warburton, and adopt in the main the text of the last octavo edition
which had appeared during the lifetime of the poet. The honour of
Warburton is not above suspicion, but Mr. Croker was misled by erroneous
inferences when he accused him of tampering with the text, and falsely
pleading the authority of "a copy corrected by the author himself."</p>

<p>Fantastic in his conceptions, violent in his animosities, hasty and
imperious in the expression of his opinions, Warburton sometimes
repented his rashness, and cancelled numerous leaves in his Shakespeare
and Pope after the volumes were printed off. Mr. Kilvert, who edited his
Literary Remains, found among his papers a cancelled leaf of the Pope,
containing the commencement of the Prologue to the Satires. On the first
page Warburton had inserted among the "Variations" a couplet which he
said was copied from the manuscript of Pope:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now vile poets rise before the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walk, like Margaret's ghost, at dead of night.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The allusion was to the ballad of William and Margaret, written by
Mallet. He was the ally of Pope and Bolingbroke, and when Pope was dead
he was employed by Bolingbroke to blast the memory of their former
friend.<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The mention of Margaret's ghost gave Warburton the
opportunity of appending a bitter note upon Mallet, whom he accused of
"arraigning his dead patron for a cheat," and the leaf was cancelled to
get rid of both note and variation. Mr. Croker believed that Warburton
"forged" the variation to gratify his spleen against Mallet, whom he
detested, and that before the volume was published "either his own
conscience, or some prudent friend, suggested that such manifest fraud
would not be tolerated." The conjecture was unfounded. Pope presented
several of his manuscripts to the son of Jonathan Richardson, the
portrait-painter, for his trouble in collating them with the printed
text. Richardson's interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope's
poetry passed into the hands of Malone, and was ultimately bought by Mr.
Croker. The manuscripts which Richardson possessed in the handwriting of
Pope were purchased by Dr. Chauncey, and are still the property of his
descendants. Among them is the Prologue to the Satires, and it contains
the couplet Mr. Croker believed to have been forged. In every instance
where the manuscripts exist the variations printed by Warburton are
found to be authentic.</p>

<p>The inference of Mr. Croker from the variations must be reversed. They
do not invalidate, but attest, the fidelity of Warburton, and the
"alterations" in the text of the poems must pass unchallenged unless
there is some direct proof of their inaccuracy. The arguments, on the
contrary, are altogether in their favour. Four printed pages of the
first Moral Essay, with the corrections in manuscript, were discovered
by Mr. Kilvert among Warburton's papers. "Some of the words," says Mr.
Croker, "are so neatly written as to leave a strong impression on my eye
of their being Pope's; other portions of the manuscript are more like
Warburton's looser hand." The faint doubt expressed by Mr. Croker would
hardly have arisen if his suspicion had not been previously awakened,
for the corrections<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> are all indubitably in the handwriting of the poet.
Nor was the manuscript in this instance the guide of Warburton. He
followed a copy of the Moral Essays printed by Pope in his last illness,
though never published. "Warburton has the propriety of it as you know,"
wrote Bolingbroke to Lord Marchmont, one of the executors; "alter it he
cannot by the terms of the will."<a name="FNanchor_2_17" id="FNanchor_2_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_17" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This of itself is an answer to Mr.
Croker. The executors had access to Pope's latest printed version of the
Moral Essays, which was Warburton's avowed authority, and he could not
alter a single word without certain detection, and the consequent
forfeiture of his legacy. He was alive to the risk. A portion of Pope's
revised edition of his poetical works was passing through the press at
the time of his death, and Warburton directed the printer to give the
sheets, when the executors inquired for them, to their colleague the
celebrated Murray, who was afterwards Lord Mansfield, adding, "Pray
preserve all the press copy to the least scrap."<a name="FNanchor_3_18" id="FNanchor_3_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_18" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The terms of the
will bound the editor to be faithful to his trust, under a penalty of
4,000<i>l.</i>, the estimated value of the bequest,<a name="FNanchor_4_19" id="FNanchor_4_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_19" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and he saw the
necessity of having the voucher of the poet's handwriting for the
minutest departure from the previous text in such of the proofs as had
not received Pope's final imprimatur. A more ample guarantee could not
be desired for the authenticity of the particulars in which Warburton's
text differs from the printed copies superintended by Pope. All the
displaced readings, which are not utterly insignificant, are preserved
in the notes to the present edition, as well as numerous unpublished
variations, which are taken from the manuscripts of Pope, or the
transcripts of Richardson.</p>

<p>The text of Pope's poems is more easily settled than elucidated. No
other poet so near to our own time presents equal difficulties. His
satires abound in uncertain allusions, and controverted topics which
require a large amount of illustration and discussion. His philosophy
was not understood by himself, and it is a study to disentangle his
confused arguments, and interpret his doubtful language. He often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
expressed his opinions with wilful ambiguity, took refuge in
equivocations, or had recourse to falsehoods, and we are constantly
forced upon perplexing investigations to recover the truth he
endeavoured to conceal. Fortunately his best poems and choicest passages
are least incumbered with puzzling questions, and his obscurities have
not much interfered with his popularity because the mass of readers are
content to enjoy the beauties and leave the enigmas unsolved.</p>

<p>The number and eminence of the commentators on Pope, the diversity of
their attainments, and the extent of their annotations appear to promise
all the help which knowledge, acuteness, and taste could supply. The
result is far below what might reasonably have been anticipated.
Warburton, Pope's first editor, had a vigorous understanding, and
possessed the enormous advantage that he carried on the work in concert
with the poet, and could ask the explanation of every difficulty. A
diseased ambition rendered his talents and opportunities useless.
Without originality he aspired to be original, and imagined that to
fabricate hollow paradoxes, and torture language into undesigned
meanings was the surest evidence of a fertile, penetrating genius. He
employed his sagacity less to discover than to distort the ideas of his
author, and seems to have thought that the more he deviated from the
obvious sense the greater would be his fame for inventive power. He has
left no worse specimen of his perverse propensity than the spurious
fancies, and idle refinements he fathered upon Pope. They are among his
baldest paradoxes, are conveyed in his heaviest style, and are supported
by his feeblest sophistry. His lifeless and verbose conceits soon
provoke by their falsity, and fatigue by their ponderousness. Lord
Marchmont said laughingly to Pope that "he must be the vainest man
alive, and must want to show posterity what a quantity of dulness he
could carry down on his back without sinking under the load."<a name="FNanchor_5_20" id="FNanchor_5_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_20" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
exuberant self-sufficiency of Warburton deluded him into the belief that
the text derived its principal lustre from the commentary. He selected
for the frontispiece to his edition a monument on which were hung
medallions of himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> and the poet, and Blakey, the draughtsman, told
Burke that "it was by Warburton's particular desire that he made him the
principal figure, and Pope only secondary, and that the light, contrary
to the rules of art, goes upwards from Warburton to Pope." A gentleman
remarked, when Burke related the anecdote, that they were drawn looking
in opposite directions.<a name="FNanchor_6_21" id="FNanchor_6_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_21" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The sarcasm summed up the opinion which has
always prevailed. The clumsy inventions of Warburton had not the
semblance of plausibility, and scarce anybody except his shadow, and
fulsome echo, Bishop Hurd, ever doubted that the text and commentary
looked different ways.<a name="FNanchor_7_22" id="FNanchor_7_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_22" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Proud of his dreary paradoxes, Warburton scorned the humble office of
furnishing useful information. Pope had said, in his Imitations of
Horace, that because three ladies liked a luckless play, a spendthrift
had taken the whole house upon the poet's night,<a name="FNanchor_8_23" id="FNanchor_8_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_23" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which drew from
Warburton the following note:&mdash;"The common reader, I am sensible, will
be always more solicitous about the names of these three ladies, the
unlucky play, and every other circumstance that attended this piece of
gallantry, than for the explanation of our author's sense, or the
illustration of his poetry, even where he is most moral and sublime. But
had it been in Mr. Pope's purpose to indulge so impertinent a curiosity,
he had sought elsewhere for a commentator on his writings. Which defect
in these notes, the periodical scribblers, however, have been stupid and
shameless enough to object to them."<a name="FNanchor_9_24" id="FNanchor_9_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_24" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Warburton's reserve was
praiseworthy when his motive was respect for private feelings. His
general neglect to clear up the allusions in Pope's poems did not admit
of this apology, and in default of a better defence he called his
critics "stupid and shameless." His habit when reasons failed him was to
supply their place with abuse.</p>

<p>The edition of Warburton was published in 1751, and no attempt was made
to supersede it till Gilbert Wakefield commenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> a new edition in 1794.
He was "labouring," he says, "for a subsistence," and the cost of the
work, which was printed at his own expense, obliged him to bring out a
volume at a time. Before the first volume was quite through the press he
learned that Joseph Warton was engaged on a similar undertaking. Warton
had the support of the London booksellers, and the edition of Wakefield
ended with his opening volume. The world did not lose the benefit of his
annotations. He published in 1796 his Observations on Pope, which
consist of notes on the remaining poems, and of supplemental notes to
the poems he had previously edited. Wakefield said that an "inculpable
perfection pervaded the whole body of Pope's compositions," and in the
extravagance of his admiration he overlaid the volume of his unfinished
edition with weak rhapsodies which masked the useful part of his
labours. He restrained his eulogistic excesses in his Observations, and
kept more closely to his main design of tracing Pope's "imitations of
his predecessors." All persons tolerably read in poetry could perceive
that the obligations Pope acknowledged in his notes were but a fraction
of the whole, and in 1740, Bowyer, the printer, with the assistance of
Mr. Clarke, a clergyman, commenced a collection of parallel passages.
From the letters of Clarke to Bowyer it appears that Pope was annoyed.
Bowyer profited by his irritation, and offered to treat with him. "I
think," wrote Clarke in 1742, "you buy his friendship cheap with a whole
hecatomb of notes, essays, illustrations, and the mob of
commentators."<a name="FNanchor_10_25" id="FNanchor_10_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_25" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The progress of the negociation is not recorded. The
result is revealed in the fact that Bowyer shortly afterwards became
Pope's printer. The sensitiveness which was disturbed at the gleanings
of Bowyer would have shuddered at the abundant harvest of Wakefield. He
himself had no intention of depreciating the merits of Pope. He only
wished to illustrate a favourite author. Many of the parallelisms are
too slight to be applicable, or they are common phrases the property of
every Englishman. A vast number remain which are a curious exhibition of
Pope's patience and skill in the art of poetical mosaic, and of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
large amount of borrowed beauties he intermixed with his undoubted
originality. The interpretation of the text, though subordinate with
Wakefield, was not neglected by him. He and a friend who assisted him,
Dr. William Bennet, Bishop of Cloyne, have explained more allusions than
all the other commentators, and the least known and appreciated of the
editors of Pope is the man who has done the most for his author.</p>

<p>The edition of Warton appeared in 1797. "His reason," he says in his
preface, "for undertaking the work was the universal complaint that Dr.
Warburton had disfigured and disgraced his edition with many forced and
far-sought interpretations, totally unsupported by the passages which
they were brought to elucidate." Warton had the stimulus of a second
motive. He published in 1756 the first volume of his Essay on Pope, and
his criticisms were roughly attacked in many passages of Ruffhead's Life
of the poet, which was prompted and partly written by Warburton. While
Warburton lived Warton did not venture to retaliate. The thirty years
which intervened had not extinguished his resentment, and he seized the
opportunity to revenge the ancient grudge. His consciousness of
Warburton's defects did not keep Warton from repeating the error of
filling page upon page with irrelevant matter. His Essay on Pope had
been a receptacle for his store of miscellaneous reading, and in a
separate work there was no objection to a medley of anecdote and
criticism. He was seventy-five when he published his edition of Pope,
and to save himself trouble he apportioned out the old farrago in notes.
Profuse in digressions, he is sparing of needful explanations. His turn
was for the lighter portions of criticism and biography, and most of his
apposite remarks are critical opinions. They are often just, but never
profound, for he had neither fervid feelings nor a robust understanding,
and his highest qualities are a fair poetical taste, and a tolerable
acquaintance with ancient and modern authors.</p>

<p>Bowles was a school-boy at Winchester when Warton was head-master, and
he intimated that this early connection was the cause of his being
employed to revise the next edition of Pope. It appeared in 1806. His
poetic sensibility was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> exquisite, and he was well-read, shrewd, and
candid. His failing was a hurry of mind which disqualified him for a
painstaking commentator. He was content to jot down in a careless,
colloquial style the off-hand thoughts of his quick and cultivated
intellect, and he did not add much to the scanty explanations of Warton
and Warburton. The chief merit of his edition is his excellent literary
criticism, which is truer, deeper, and more refined than that of his old
Winchester master. The estimate Bowles formed of the poetry and
character of Pope was allowed to pass unchallenged for thirteen years,
when some remarks of Campbell, in his Specimens of British Poets,
commenced a controversy which lasted from 1819 to 1826. In the series of
pamphlets he published to vindicate his opinions, Bowles exhibited his
wonted acuteness, courage, and negligence. With all his slips in minor
points the fresh facts which have come to light have more than confirmed
his view of Pope's moral obliquities, and in the discussion on the
principles of poetry he reduced the whole of his adversaries to silence.
He and Hazlitt were the only persons among the disputants, eminent or
obscure, who showed any real comprehension of the subject.</p>

<p>The next edition of Pope, justly considered by Mr. Croker to be the
worst, came out in 1824, and was superintended by Roscoe, the author of
the Life of Lorenzo de Medici, and Leo X. He barely contributed a single
illustrative note, his criticisms are platitudes, and his vindications
of Pope a tissue of blunders. He was misled by his credulous faith in
his hero, by the rashness with which he imposed his own guesses for
facts, and above all by his want of penetration and research. His
half-knowledge was worse than ignorance. A few of his multitudinous
errors were exposed by Bowles whom he had attacked. Roscoe replied in a
feeble, disingenuous pamphlet, which drew from Bowles his taunting and
crushing retort, Lessons in Criticism to William Roscoe, Esq. This ended
the Pope controversy.</p>

<p>The faults of plan and execution in the editions of Warburton, Warton,
Bowles, and Roscoe stand out in strong relief, and Mr. Croker resolved,
as far as possible, to correct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> the mistakes, retrench the
superfluities, and supply the omissions. Warton and Bowles dismissed a
large proportion of the barren, oppressive commentaries of Warburton.
Roscoe put back the whole of the bulky excrescence. Most of it had been
adopted by Pope, and to relieve the text, without excluding
interpretations sanctioned by the poet, Mr. Croker determined to print
the pedantic lumber in appendixes. The notes of the other editors rested
upon their intrinsic merits, and he intended to sift out the surplusage,
and only retain what was pertinent. To curtail is easy. The difficulty
was to clear up the many obscurities which remained, and Mr. Croker was
anxious to furnish his share of explanation, though he was convinced
that numerous contemporary allusions would always baffle curiosity. His
chief attention was directed to the satires, and he continued for many
years to pursue his investigations, and accumulate materials. His busy
life was succeeded by failing health, and he died before he had prepared
his notes for the press. The results of his research have luckily all
been preserved, for his habit was to write them out in full at the time.
He was an acute and eager enquirer into political, personal, and social
history, and no man could have been more competent to bring to the
surface the under-current of forgotten circumstances.</p>

<p>I have kept to the plan sketched out by Mr. Croker. "A commentary," says
Johnson, "must arise from the fortuitous discoveries of many men in
devious walks of literature," and few poets have had more commentators
than Pope. I have borrowed whatever I met with in previous writers that
throw light upon his meaning, faults, and beauties, have cast aside what
was plainly inapplicable and erroneous, and have done what I could to
fill up deficiencies. My own notes will be recognised by the absence of
any signature; all other notes throughout the work have the names of
their authors attached, even when a note is by the same author as the
text. The extracts from Warton are sometimes taken from his Essay, and
both in his case and that of Bowles I have occasionally joined together
scattered fragments which were connected in their subject. The rest of
the arrangements will be understood at a glance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>The letters of Pope demand a more particular discussion. Estimated by
their intrinsic merits they would call for little notice. "He laboured
them," says Horace Walpole, "as much as the Essay on Man, and as they
were written to everybody they do not look as if they had been written
to anybody."<a name="FNanchor_11_26" id="FNanchor_11_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_26" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Their dry and frigid generalities could not be more
happily exposed. The chief importance of the correspondence is in its
relation to the morality of Pope, and the fame of men whose reputation
is involved in the question of his uprightness. His real nature has
always been hotly debated. "His detractors," says De Quincey, "fancy
that in his character a basis of ignoble qualities was here and there
slightly relieved by a few shining spots; we, on the contrary, believe
that in Pope lay a disposition radically noble and generous, clouded and
overshadowed by superficial foibles; or, to adopt the distinction of
Shakespeare, they see nothing but 'dust a little gilt,' and we 'gold a
little dusted.'"<a name="FNanchor_12_27" id="FNanchor_12_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_27" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Pope boasted loudly of his virtue, and his
champions judge him by his own representations. His accusers hold that
his professions were hypocritical, as when Lord Macaulay speaks of his
"spite and envy, thinly disguised by sentiments as benevolent and noble
as those which Sir Peter Teazle admired in Mr. Joseph Surface."<a name="FNanchor_13_28" id="FNanchor_13_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_28" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
charges brought against him are thickly scattered over his life, and
either the guilty appearances are deceptive, or we must admit that his
mind was essentially corrupt. His correspondence brings up the
ever-recurring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> enquiry, and we have to decide whether his letters are
not many of them fraudulent, and the circumstances attending their
publication a series of ignominious plots, infamous false accusations,
and impudent lies.</p>

<p>Every examination into the history of the letters was slight before Mr.
Dilke engaged in the laborious task. His familiarity with the books,
pamphlets, and periodicals of the time could not be exceeded, and his
doubts once awakened he accepted nothing upon trust. With an immense
amount of research and skill he proceeded to track Pope through his
tortuous courses. He laid bare the ramifications of the plot against
Curll, which was only known in a few of its prominent particulars. He
detected, what none of the editors and biographers had perceived, the
base man&oelig;uvres and deceit which accompanied the publication of the
"Letters to and from Dr. Swift." He was originally put upon his
investigations by the manuscript collection of Pope's letters to Caryll,
and these revealed a new set of frauds in the evidence they supplied of
letters converted into a fictitious correspondence. His inclination was
to favour Pope whenever there was an opening for a liberal
interpretation, and it was not from hostility that he exposed the
net-work of fraud, and brought out the dark traits of a dishonourable
disposition with new and terrible force. He printed his discoveries in
the Athen&aelig;um<a name="FNanchor_14_29" id="FNanchor_14_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_29" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, and after studying the facts afresh by the light of
his essays, I am compelled to adopt his conclusions. The evidence upon
which they rest is often circumstantial and intricate, and cannot be
followed to the end without steady attention, and some trial of
patience.</p>

<p>The letters of the poet which were first sent to the press were given by
Cromwell to his mistress, Elizabeth Thomas, who sold them in her
distress to Curll for ten guineas. She was a shameless woman, and boldly
justified her conduct. "Everyone," she said, "knows that the person to
whom a letter is addressed has the same right to dispose of it as he has
of goods purchased with his money." The right which originally belonged
to Cromwell, of publishing to the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> whatever had been written to
him in the confidence of friendship, he had, by his gift, transferred to
herself; and thus it appeared that Cromwell had a right to be
treacherous to Pope, and Mrs. Thomas a right to be treacherous to both
Pope and Cromwell. With more reason she inferred that neither of them at
heart would be vexed at the proceeding. Cromwell, she urged, could not
be angry that the world should know "the professions of love, gratitude,
and veneration made him by so celebrated an author," and Pope could not
resent the exhibition of the "early pregnancy of his genius." "And yet,"
she continued, "had either of you been asked, common modesty would have
obliged you to refuse what you would not be displeased with if done
without your knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_15_30" id="FNanchor_15_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_30" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> There can be little doubt, from his
subsequent conduct, that this was the light in which the publication was
viewed by the poet, notwithstanding his assertion in a note to the
Dunciad, "that he was ashamed of the letters as very trivial things,
full not only of levities, but of wrong judgments of men and books, and
only excusable from the youth and inexperience of the writer." Mrs.
Thomas did him an incalculable injury, not by revealing his secrets, but
by flattering his vanity. The favourable reception of his correspondence
originated the desire to give some further specimens to the world, and
led him into the miserable series of falsehoods and frauds by which he
endeavoured to accomplish his design without seeming to be privy to it.</p>

<p>The letters to Cromwell were published in Curll's "Miscellanea," of
which the title-page says "Printed in the year 1727;" but the dedication
to the letters themselves is dated June, 1726, and it was in 1726 that
they appeared. The incidental and scanty notices of them at the time are
sufficient to indicate the impression they produced. Thompson, writing
in October to Aaron Hill, says that "though careless and uncorrected,
they are full of wit and gaiety." There may have been many who thought
that they did as much credit to the heart as to the head of the poet. "I
have read the collection of letters you mention," Fenton wrote to Broome
in September,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> 1726, "and was delighted with nothing more than that air
of sincerity, those professions of esteem and respect, and that
deference paid to his friend's judgment in poetry which I have sometimes
seen expressed to others, and I doubt not with the same cordial
affection. If they are read in that light, they will be very
entertaining and useful in the present age; but in the next, Cicero,
Pliny, and Voiture may regain their reputation." The comments on Pope's
sincerity were plainly ironical. Fenton considered him to be extremely
hypocritical, and some person concerned in the publication of 1726 must
have formed the same opinion of his character, if the ludicrous
tail-piece is intended to be typical of the letters. A little man whose
diminutive stature did not permit him to clasp the taller figure in his
arms while they stood upon a level, is represented as having jumped off
the ground and seized his companion round the waist, who, with his hands
thrown into the air at the painful vehemence of the embrace, is
struggling to get loose. Undiscerning persons, who judged the poet by
his words, would form a different estimate, and would perceive only
proofs of his excellence where Fenton saw examples of his habitual
insincerity. "His correspondence," says Johnson, of the later collection
of 1735, "filled the nation with praises of his candour, tenderness, and
benevolence, the purity of his purposes, and the fidelity of his
friendship."<a name="FNanchor_16_31" id="FNanchor_16_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_31" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The letters to Cromwell had more than an ephemeral success. Curll, in
his reply in 1729 to the attack on him in the Dunciad, after noticing
Pope's affected depreciation of them, says, "However, they sell very
well; price 5<i>s.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_17_32" id="FNanchor_17_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_32" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The poet had already devised an excuse for
following them up by a second set. Theobald, who had earned his lasting
enmity by pointing out the errors in his edition of Shakespeare, was
employed by some booksellers to edit the posthumous papers of Wycherley,
which had been purchased from his heir. The work appeared in 1728. Pope
saw in this circumstance a pretence for dragging his own letters before
the world, and an opportunity of gratifying his spleen against Theobald.
He said that the poems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span> were disreputable to the memory of his early
friend, and that the correspondence was published because it showed that
it was his last resolution to have suppressed them.<a name="FNanchor_18_33" id="FNanchor_18_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_33" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It showed the
reverse. The last printed letter of Wycherley exhibits him as intent as
ever upon preparing his poems for the press, and if we are to believe
that he subsequently abandoned the design, we must accept the fact upon
the bare assertion of Pope, which derives no support from any part of
the correspondence. But though it failed to answer the purpose avowed by
its editor, it answered purposes not avowed which were much nearer to
his heart. It shows that the verses of Wycherley were rugged, feeble,
and full of repetitions, and that whatever they possessed of strength
and harmony was due to the revision of Pope. It shows that he furnished
entire passages, and where the text is not explicit on the point he is
careful to reclaim his contributions in the notes. It displays on the
one hand the "first sprightly runnings" of the precocious young poet,
and on the other the "last dull droppings" of the veteran author, who
was verging upon his dotage. "If we were to judge," says Warburton, "of
this set of letters by the manner of thinking and turn of expression, we
should conclude that they were all mistitled, and that those given to
the boy of sixteen were written by the man of seventy, and the
contrary,&mdash;such sober sense, such gravity of manners, and so much
judgment and knowledge of composition, enlivened with manly wit,
distinguish those of Mr. Pope, while a childish jealousy, a puerile
affectation, a lying at catch for points, together with a total contempt
of method, make up the character of those of Mr. Wycherley." Warton
transcribes the judgment of Warburton, and adds his testimony to the
superiority of the letters of Pope. He says that he "has excelled
Wycherley in his own way of striving to be always witty," and that "the
perpetual attempt of the vain old man to be brilliant, the accumulation
of simile upon simile, the antithesis, the cant of satire, the severity
on authors, critics, and women, are sufficiently disgusting." In short,
the whole effect of the correspondence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span> was to display the infirmities
of Wycherley and the merits of Pope; and his mode of relieving his
departed friend from the reproach of the posthumous poems was to reveal
the secret that the only portions of them which might have done him
credit were not his own, but the work of this zealous vindicator of his
fame.</p>

<p>With such a futile excuse for printing the letters, Pope was anxious to
throw the responsibility upon some other person. He was the intimate
friend of Edward, the second Earl of Oxford, who, without being
possessed of much ability, courted the society of eminent men, and who,
with no great tincture of literature, had inherited from his father a
passion for collecting books and manuscripts. His correspondence with
the poet descended, with the rest of his personal papers, to his only
child, who married the Duke of Portland in 1734. From the Duchess the
papers passed to her eldest daughter, Lady Elizabeth, wife to the third
Viscount Weymouth, who subsequently became the first Marquess of Bath.
The Oxford manuscripts were consequently removed to Longleat, where they
have remained ever since among the treasures of a library which is
worthy of the regal edifice it adorns.<a name="FNanchor_19_34" id="FNanchor_19_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_34" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In Pope's letters to his
friend we have his own record of the device he adopted. He wrote to Lord
Oxford in September, 1729, and complained that the publication of
Wycherley's posthumous poems was derogatory to their author, as well as
to the critic who had advised him to re-cast them. "Something," he said,
"will be necessary to be done to clear both his and my reputation, which
the letters under his hand will abundantly do; for which particular
reason I would desire to have them lodged in your lordship's hands." He
had been slow in discovering that something was necessary to be done to
clear the reputation of his deceased friend; for Theobald's book had
come forth in 1728, and it was now the autumn of 1729. His tardy zeal
appears to have been entirely begotten by the idea that it could be made
the pretext for producing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span> the correspondence; but having once conceived
the scheme, he did not allow it to languish. On the 6th of October he
advanced a step further, and began to shadow forth the real object of
the request. He informed Lord Oxford that some of the letters were to be
printed, and asked permission to state that they were already in his
library, "which," says he, "they shall be as soon as you will give
orders to any one to receive them." "I would not," he went on, "appear
myself as publisher of them, but any one else may, or even the
bookseller be supposed to have procured copies of them,&mdash;formerly or
now, it is equal. Certain it is that no other way can justice be
rendered to the memory of a man to whom I had the first obligations of
friendship, almost in my childhood." Lord Oxford merely replied that if
the documents were left in a box with the porter, the man had orders to
place it in the library, and that any mention of that library would be
agreeable to its owner;<a name="FNanchor_20_35" id="FNanchor_20_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_35" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but he took no notice of the intimation that
the poet designed to ascribe the publication to an imaginary agent. Pope
now considered him to be sufficiently prepared, and his next letter
disclosed the whole of the scheme, and at the same time announced its
execution. It then appeared that his noble dupe, who, as he was both
weak and amiable, was expected to prove a submissive tool, had been
asked to become the keeper of the manuscripts, that he might be held up
to the world as their publisher. "I am extremely obliged to you," Pope
wrote to him, "for your kind permission to quote your library, and to
mention it in what manner I pleased. I consulted Mr. Lewis upon the turn
of the preface, and have exceeded perhaps my commission on one point,
though we both judged it the right way; for I have made the publishers
say that your lordship permitted them a copy of some of the papers from
the library, where the originals remain as testimonies of the truth. It
is indeed no more than a justice due to the dead and to the living
author."<a name="FNanchor_21_36" id="FNanchor_21_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_36" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In other words, his lordship was asserted to have permitted
the bookseller to print the papers in his library, when they were not
even sent to his house till after they were printed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span> and this fiction
was fathered upon him without so much as his leave being asked, or his
having been suffered to read a single line of the work he was stated to
have authorised. When Pope alleged that the proceeding was "no more than
a justice due to the dead and the living author," he must have hoped
that the outrage to Lord Oxford of which he had been guilty in
committing the act, would appear to be diminished by the assurance with
which he communicated it. His deceptions were not confined to the
preface. He shortly afterwards wrote to Swift, and contrived to mention
that he had contracted a friendship at sixteen with a man of seventy. "I
speak," he said, "of old Mr. Wycherley, some letters of whom,
by-the-bye, and of mine, the booksellers have got and printed, not
without the concurrence of a noble friend of mine and yours. I do not
much approve of it, though there is nothing in it for me to be ashamed
of, because I will not be ashamed of anything I do not do myself, or of
anything that is not immoral, but merely dull."<a name="FNanchor_22_37" id="FNanchor_22_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_37" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The booksellers had
printed the letters with the concurrence of a noble friend, and the
noble friend had never heard a word on the subject till the printing was
completed. Pope did not much approve of it, and he had protested to Lord
Oxford that in no other way could justice be rendered to the memory of a
man to whom he had the first obligations of friendship. He would not be
ashamed of what he did not do himself, and he alone had edited the work
and sent it to the press. The value of his asseverations may be measured
by the triple falsehood he volunteered to Swift. He was aware that the
arguments by which he hoped to persuade Lord Oxford to become his dupe
would not impose upon the penetrating understanding of the Dean, and he
therefore openly repudiated what he was unable to excuse. If the
publication had vindicated Wycherley, it would have been its own
justification; but as it was put forth to do honour to Pope, he
sacrificed his veracity to avoid the imputation of vanity. He cruelly
sneered, in his "Prologue to the Satires" at the poor garretteer, who
urged the plea for printing his compositions that he was "obliged by
hunger and request of friends." The poet had not the excuse of hunger,
and he improved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span> upon the model he satirised when he pretended that
<i>his</i> friends had taken his papers, and printed them against his will.</p>

<p>The deception which Pope practised was never suspected till it was
revealed by his correspondence with Lord Oxford, which has hitherto
remained in manuscript. The repetition of the attempt on a more
elaborate scale was less successful, and it has always been believed by
the immense majority of inquirers that the promulgation of the
collection of 1735, which the poet vehemently denounced as an act of
intolerable treachery, was from first to last his own deed. "It seems,"
says Johnson, "that Pope being desirous of printing his letters, and not
knowing how to do, without imputation of vanity, what has in this
country been done very rarely, contrived an appearance of compulsion,
that when he could complain that his letters were surreptitiously
published, he might decently and defensively publish them himself."<a name="FNanchor_23_38" id="FNanchor_23_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_38" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Fresh facts have rendered the evidence against him stronger than ever,
and the whole derives increased force from the information we now
possess that he had previously had recourse to a kindred falsehood. In
the first case he made a tool of a friend; in the second, he varied his
plan, and made a tool of an enemy.</p>

<p>Pope tells us, in the preface to the authorised edition of his
correspondence, which he brought out in quarto in 1737, that his disgust
at the publication of his letters to Cromwell, and "the apprehension of
more treatment of the same kind, put him upon recalling as many as he
could from those who he imagined had kept any."<a name="FNanchor_24_39" id="FNanchor_24_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_39" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He applied to his
friend Caryll, in December, 1726, to surrender his collection; and, on
renewing the request a few days later, he added, "I have desired the
same thing of Mrs. Blount, with whose late worthy husband I entertained
so long a correspondence, and of all others." It was more than two years
before Caryll could be induced to comply with the demand, and it would
seem that Mrs. Blount was little less backward; for, on November 28,
1729, Pope wrote to Swift, "I <i>lately</i> received from the widow of one
dead correspondent, and the father of another,<a name="FNanchor_25_40" id="FNanchor_25_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_40" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> several of my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
letters of about fifteen and twenty years old." When the poet had
gleaned together all the letters he could extort, "he immediately," he
says, "lessened the number by burning three parts in four of them: the
rest he spared, not in any preference of their style or writing, but
merely as they preserved the memory of some friendships which will ever
be dear to him, or set in a true light some matters of fact from which
the scribblers of the time had taken occasion to asperse either his
friends or himself." He was not more anxious to destroy the three parts
than to secure the fourth from destruction. "He laid by the originals
together with those of his correspondents, and caused a copy to be taken
to deposit in the library of a noble friend, that in case either of the
revival of slanders, or the publication of surreptitious letters during
his life or after, a proper use might be made of them."<a name="FNanchor_26_41" id="FNanchor_26_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_41" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The noble
friend was Lord Oxford, and the request to be allowed to place the
letters in his library was made by Pope in September, 1729, when he
stated that "he had had it at heart for half a year and more." Upon
obtaining Lord Oxford's consent, he had the correspondence transcribed
under his own inspection; and on October 16 he says, "I am causing the
manuscripts to be fairly written, and hope at your lordship's return to
be the presenter of them in person." By his own avowal he had carefully
culled his letters, had prepared the selected portions for some public
purpose, and had taken the unusual precaution of preserving them in
duplicate. The end which he declared they were intended to serve was a
palpable pretence. He never specified any slanders they refuted, and he
could have had little idea of employing them to test the truth of
surreptitious letters when he began by burning three parts of the
collection, and only retained a fourth. The manifest fact was, that,
while he was desirous of consigning to oblivion those portions of his
correspondence which would not add to his reputation, he was eager to
circulate the picked specimens which he imagined would promote his fame.</p>

<p>No advance seems to have been made towards the accomplishment of his
design till 1733, when Curll advertised a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span> life of Pope. An unknown
person who wrote a feigned hand, and who signed his letters with the
initials P. T., then opened a correspondence with the bookseller, and
furnished some information upon the genealogy of the poet. He vindicated
him from the charge of plebeian descent, and affirmed that he sprung
from the same stock as Lord Downe.<a name="FNanchor_27_42" id="FNanchor_27_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_42" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This assertion was repeated by
Pope in one of the notes to his "Prologue to the Satires," though Mr.
Pottinger, his cousin, ridiculed the "fine pedigree," which had never
been heard of in the family, and which there is nothing to confirm.<a name="FNanchor_28_43" id="FNanchor_28_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_43" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
There is thus at starting a curious identity between the apocryphal
statements of P. T. and the apocryphal statements of Pope. But as P. T.
must have had access to the manuscripts in the keeping of Lord Oxford,
he might be supposed to have found the account among the memoranda of
the poet, and no great stress could be laid upon the coincidence to
prove that P. T. was Pope in disguise, if the general tenor of the
correspondence did not indicate its origin.</p>

<p>There was a feud between Pope and Curll. The bookseller believed that
the poet had drugged him with an emetic, he had been subsequently
satirised in the Dunciad, and he had lost no opportunity of retaliating.
An uncompromising panegyric upon his antagonist would have run counter
to his prejudices, and while P. T. is careful to tell nothing which is
not for the honour of Pope, he has the precaution to consult the
antipathies of Curll. He pretends that the poet, with whom he was
formerly well acquainted, has treated him like a stranger, and that he
cannot give so good an account of his manners as of his parentage. He
promises, if he receives encouragement, to make these moral deficiencies
the subject of a future letter, "without entering into anything in
anywise libellous." He omitted, however, in his next communication, to
keep this part of his engagement, and never reverted to it. He had
spoken of Pope's family in the same flattering and perhaps fictitious
terms as Pope himself; but, in spite of his pledge, and his animosity,
he forbore to relate the minutest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span> particular to the discredit of the
poet. The inconsistency between the assumed character and the actual
conduct of P. T. is much too glaring. An enemy would have been far less
partial and considerate.</p>

<p>The first communication of P. T. was dated October 1733. He directed
Curll to signify the acceptance of his offer by inserting in the Daily
Advertiser the notice, "E. C. hath received a letter, and will comply
with P. T." This Curll did, and on the 15th of November got an answer
from P. T., in which the true purpose of the man&oelig;uvre transpires.
Instead of sending traits of the defects in Pope's manners, he announces
that he has "a large collection of his letters from the former part of
his days till the year 1727, which will alone make the most authentic
memoirs of him that could be." He adds that they will form a four or
five shilling volume, and "yet I expect no more," he says, "than what
will barely pay a transcriber, that the originals may be preserved in
mine or your hands to vouch for the truth of them." He appealed to the
hatred as well as to the avarice of the bookseller. He again asserted
that he had experienced bad treatment from Pope and that his sole motive
was "to bestow upon him" the same "care" which Curll had done
already.<a name="FNanchor_29_44" id="FNanchor_29_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_44" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Again his thirst for retaliation ended in homage, for the
collection consisted of the identical letters which the poet had
prepared for the press, and which were intended to raise instead of to
lower his reputation. The conduct of P. T., who, having abjured profit
and only feigned revenge, was to get nothing by his roguery, is
altogether incomprehensible, if we are to suppose that he was what he
professed; but his conduct ceases to be a mystery if P. T. was Pope,
who, having finished editing his letters, may be presumed to have had
the same desire to find a pretext for printing them as he had exhibited
in the instance of the correspondence with Wycherley.</p>

<p>The point upon which the bargain went off for a time is equally
significant. P. T. enclosed an advertisement of the letters, and
required as a preliminary that it should be put forth by Curll, "for I
shall not," he said, "be justified to some people on whom I have
dependence, unless it seem to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span> public eye as no entire act of mine;
but I may be justified and excused if, after they see such a collection
is made by you, I acknowledge I sent some letters to contribute
thereto."<a name="FNanchor_30_45" id="FNanchor_30_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_45" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> This reasoning carries its own refutation. If his patrons
could believe that Curll, without his aid, had got at the bulk of the
correspondence, they would quite as readily have credited that he had
not assisted the bookseller to the remainder. Nor is it likely that the
men who would have renounced P. T. if he had been a principal in the
business, would have connived at his becoming an accomplice. His plea
was as fanciful as his desire for revenge; but assume that Pope was the
real negotiator and his motive is transparent. The advertisement would
have threatened that very surreptitious publication of his letters,
against which he affirmed that he kept his own version in readiness. He
would have repudiated the impending piracy, and hastened in self-defence
to commit the genuine edition to the press. The promise contained in the
advertisement, that "the originals would be shown at Curll's when the
book was published," would have empowered him to give an air of
imposture to the transaction, and to damage his foe, who when challenged
would not have been able to produce the documents. According to the
language which Pope uttered in the name of P. T. he did expect to be
justified in his proceedings by means of the advertisement, but not at
all in the manner which he wished the bookseller to believe.</p>

<p>All the conditions required by Pope seemed met together in Curll. He was
an enemy, and could be denounced when he had been deceived. He had
printed the letters to Cromwell without the consent of the poet, and it
would readily be credited that he had repeated the act. He was not nice
in his notions of honour, and he might be expected to catch at an offer,
however discreditable, which promised both profit and revenge. But
whatever might be his greediness and his malice, they had not swallowed
up his caution, and notwithstanding that P. T. wrote again to express
his dissatisfaction that no advertisement appeared, Curll forbore to
announce letters he did not possess, at the bidding of a conspirator
whose name and person he did not know. The subject in consequence slept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
from November 1733 till March 1735, when the poet was meditating some
fresh proceeding respecting his correspondence, for on the third of that
month, he requested Lord Oxford to send him by the hearer "the bound
book of copies of letters," which, he wanted, he said, "to inspect for a
day or two." There are transcripts among the Oxford papers of some of
the letters of Wycherley to Pope, which appeared in 1729. There are
transcripts of Pope's correspondence with Atterbury, which appeared in
1737. There are transcripts of a large part of the Swift correspondence,
which appeared in 1741. But while the earlier and later letters are
preserved on loose sheets the bound book has vanished, and there is not
a single transcript of any letter which was first given to the world in
the collection of 1735. The probability is that the book which Pope
professed to require for a day or two was never returned. The
circumstance is the more suspicious because he had the originals at
home, which would have served him for reference, whereas if his object
was to commit the letters clandestinely to the press he would use the
copy which had been specially prepared for the purpose,&mdash;which had been
expurgated, altered, and sometimes remodelled. Accordingly we find that
P. T. reappears at this crisis with the correspondence in print. He had
failed to lure Curll by a promise of letters which he would not produce.
He now changed his tactics, and offered him an entire impression of the
book.</p>

<p>This second act of the plot was opened by a communication of Curll to
Pope on the 22nd of March, three weeks after the letters had been
withdrawn from the library of Lord Oxford. He invited the poet to close
their differences, and, as a proof of his readiness to oblige him, sent
him the old advertisement of P. T. Curll asserted that he took the step
"by direction."<a name="FNanchor_31_46" id="FNanchor_31_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_46" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> When he republished this statement he volunteered
another, which seems to be inconsistent with it, and says that the
discovery of the advertisement, when arranging his papers, determined
him to propose a cessation of hostilities.<a name="FNanchor_32_47" id="FNanchor_32_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_47" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> As he was unconscious,
however, of any contradiction in the double account, it is probable that
he may have been influenced by some concurring advice. It strengthens
this view that Pope, in an anonymous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span> "Narrative," which he subsequently
put forth, reports what Curll told a few days later, "to persons who
sifted him in the affair,"<a name="FNanchor_33_48" id="FNanchor_33_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_48" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> which shows that the bookseller had
people about him in the interest of the poet, and these sifters, as the
critic in the Athen&aelig;um remarks, might, when needful, become prompters.
The progress of events proved that the letter of Curll was at least
singularly opportune, and if not written "by direction," was one of
those fortunate chances which often contribute to the success of the
best laid schemes. Pope replied to it by inserting an advertisement in
the "Grub Street Journal," the "Daily Journal," and "The Daily Post
Boy." He stated in this manifesto, that Curll "pretended that P. T. had
offered him to print a large collection of Pope's letters," that he
would have no correspondence with Curll, that he knew no such person as
P. T., that he believed the letters to be a forgery, and that he should
not trouble himself in the matter.<a name="FNanchor_34_49" id="FNanchor_34_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_49" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The poet might not choose to have
any intercourse with a former enemy of no good fame, but it was a
strange return for his peace-offering that he should advertise an insult
on him, and equally singular when he was incredulous, and had resolved
not to trouble himself about the matter, that he should parade in the
newspapers the contents of a private note. Yet extraordinary as was his
conduct, if he had not any covert design, it was consistent enough if he
was the agent in the plot for bringing his letters before the world. His
advertisement would convey the impression that he could not have
connived at the publication he was contriving; it would afford an
opening for P. T. to come again upon the stage; and by infuriating Curll
it would induce him to close at once with the proposal which was ready
to be made to him. In conformity with this supposition P. T., who had
not communicated with the bookseller for upwards of two years, saw the
advertisement directly it appeared, and he lost not an instant in
informing Curll that since their last negotiation he had printed the
letters.<a name="FNanchor_35_50" id="FNanchor_35_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_50" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It was true that Curll had betrayed him to Pope, but P. T.
was generous and would still give him the preference. The game required
that Pope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span> should be incapable of being conciliated, and P. T. of taking
offence.</p>

<p>P. T. demanded that Curll should show he was in earnest by putting forth
the old advertisement. Curll complied, and the negotiation went forward.
An agent was sent to him who assumed the name of Smythe and professed to
be a clergyman, but who was so little conversant with the character he
personated that he wore a clerical gown and lawyer's bands. On the 7th
of May he went to Curll's house at night; and, to bring the bargain to a
conclusion, exhibited to him most of the sheets of the volume, and a
dozen original letters.<a name="FNanchor_36_51" id="FNanchor_36_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_51" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Before Curll had published this statement
Pope, for the purpose of discrediting the promise which had been made in
the advertisement, that the originals should be produced when the book
appeared, had committed himself to the assertion that they all remained
in their proper place.<a name="FNanchor_37_52" id="FNanchor_37_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_52" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> They must nevertheless, observes the critic
in the Athen&aelig;um, have been out of his possession, and doing service on
the evening when Smythe trafficed with Curll. The bookseller was not
likely to be deceived, for he had the Cromwell correspondence in his
keeping, and knew the poet's handwriting well.<a name="FNanchor_38_53" id="FNanchor_38_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_53" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He was as little
likely to deceive, for he told the fact in the course of a
straight-forward story, without perceiving, or at least without pointing
out, its force in attesting the connivance of Pope.</p>

<p>Fifty copies of the letters were in the possession of Curll by the 12th
of May, and were speedily sold. Smythe sent for him at one o'clock to a
tavern in Leicester Fields, and half an hour afterwards one hundred and
ninety additional copies were brought by a couple of porters, who were
directed to carry them to the shop of the bookseller. There they were
immediately seized by an order from the House of Lords, and Curll was
commanded to attend next day.<a name="FNanchor_39_54" id="FNanchor_39_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_54" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The peers in 1722 had voted it a
breach of privilege to publish the writings of any member of their body
without his consent. Curll, in an advertisement which appeared for the
first time that morning, had given a list of the persons to whom Pope's
letters were addressed, and among the names were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span> those of the Earl of
Halifax and the Earl of Burlington. To print letters to lords was no
offence. It was necessary that there should be letters from them, and of
this there was no other indication than that the list of names was
followed by the words,&mdash;"with the respective answers of each
correspondent."<a name="FNanchor_40_55" id="FNanchor_40_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_55" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Curll asserted that the advertisement came to him
through Smythe,<a name="FNanchor_41_56" id="FNanchor_41_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_56" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and the proceedings founded upon it in the hour that
it issued wet from the press were, as Johnson states, instigated by
Pope, "who attended to stimulate the resentment of his friends."<a name="FNanchor_42_57" id="FNanchor_42_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_57" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> If
he had never set eyes upon the book before it was published, curiosity
would still have prompted him to turn over the leaves, and he must
immediately have discovered that it did not contain a single letter from
a peer. The wording of the advertisement may, therefore, be suspected to
have been devised by him to afford a colour for what he must have known
was a groundless prosecution. A committee was appointed to investigate
the complaint. It met on the 14th of May, and the case would have ended
as soon as it was begun, if Pope's spokesman, Lord Hay, who resided at
Twickenham, and was one of his associates, had not adduced from a letter
to Jervas a passage which he alleged to be a reflection on Lord
Burlington. But the person who furnished the work to Curll had, by an
elaborate device, provided against a charge which no one except its
contriver could have foreseen. The fifty copies, which were sold on the
morning of the 12th, before the power of the House of Lords was put in
motion, contained the letter. Those which were furnished in the middle
of the day, as if to meet the messenger sent to seize them, were all
defective, and in every case the letter to Jervas was among the
omissions.<a name="FNanchor_43_58" id="FNanchor_43_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_58" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Nor had the leaves which contained it been simply kept
back, but every trace of it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span> been obliterated by an alteration at
the printing-press. In the complete work the missing letter commenced on
p. 115 of vol. ii.<a name="FNanchor_44_59" id="FNanchor_44_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_59" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and ended on p. 117. In the imperfect books a
note on Trumbull, which began at p. 114, is carried on to the top of p.
115, and Pope's epitaph upon him, which appears in no other copies of
the correspondence, is added to cover a little of the vacant space. The
word "Finis" follows the note, though, in spite of this indication that
the whole is concluded, the work recommences on p. 117 with the letters
to Gay, which continue to p. 154.<a name="FNanchor_45_60" id="FNanchor_45_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_60" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The coincidence was far too
extraordinary to be undesigned. Pope, who had incited the prosecution
the very hour the book was published, and who had been in such haste to
instruct Lord Hay that the debate in the House of Lords was concluded,
and the sheets seized by two o'clock, could alone have adapted one batch
to afford a pretext for the proceeding, and another batch to render the
proceeding abortive,&mdash;he alone could have arranged the delivery of the
respective parcels, and sent the fifty copies which contained the
obnoxious passage, in time to be sold in the morning, and the one
hundred and ninety copies in which it was wanting, just in time to be
captured by the messenger from the House of Lords. His object was not to
procure the confiscation of the correspondence, and stop the sale. He
wished to simulate indignation, and divert suspicion from himself
without interfering with the success of the work, and he conducted the
prosecution with so much care to ensure defeat that we may readily
credit the assertion of Curll, "that the lords declared they had been
made Pope's tools."<a name="FNanchor_46_61" id="FNanchor_46_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_61" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>While the copies seized by the messenger had not the letter to Jervas,
they contained in compensation an address "to the reader," which was not
in the first fifty copies sent to Curll. This preface betrays throughout
the hand of Pope. The original proposition was that it should be
furnished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span> by Curll; and, notwithstanding the revenge by which he
professed to be actuated, P. T. maintained that the poet ought to be
mentioned with praise. "We must by no means," he said, "seem to use him
with disregard, but rather commend, lest by any circumstances I writ to
you the publisher be detected."<a name="FNanchor_47_62" id="FNanchor_47_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_62" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> I This was seven years after the
appearance of the Dunciad, and Pope was not so universally beloved as
that the intimation that the correspondence was put forth by an enemy
could direct suspicion to the culprit. The pretence was too palpable to
impose upon any one, and P. T., who, among other motives for his
procedure, probably mistrusted Curll's cordiality or skill in a
panegyric, determined upon consideration to supply it himself. He was
not sparing in his tribute. "Mr. Pope," he wrote, "has not any great
cause to think the publication much offence to his modesty, or
reflection on his judgment, when we take care to inform the public that
there are few letters of his in this collection which were not written
under twenty years of age. On the other hand, we doubt not the reader
will be much more surprised to find at that early period so much variety
of style, affecting sentiment, and justness of criticism in pieces which
must have been writ in haste, very few perhaps ever re-viewed, and none
intended for the eye of the public."<a name="FNanchor_48_63" id="FNanchor_48_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_63" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This was the very language of
the poet. He coveted the distinction of precocity of talent, and was
perpetually directing attention to the early age at which he affirmed,
and sometimes falsely, that many of his letters and poems were penned.
He asserted that his most finished epistles were thrown off in haste,
which, as they were always held to bear the marks of labour in every
sentence, is the last topic of praise that would have been selected by
anybody else. He was anxious to persuade the world that they were not
revised before they were published, and he prevaricated to foster the
deception.<a name="FNanchor_49_64" id="FNanchor_49_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_64" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> He protested that they were never meant for the press,
which no one believed, and which could least of all be credited by the
assumed traitor who transcribed them from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span> copy that had been
deposited in the library of Lord Oxford to ensure their preservation.
The vindictive P. T. was both so fortunate and so hearty in his
commendations that he proved the mere echo of Pope in his
self-applauding moods.</p>

<p>The other topics in the address "to the reader" were the same topics
which were subsequently reiterated by the poet. In his narrative of the
P. T. plot, and in the preface to the authorised edition of his
correspondence, he relates the method by which the Cromwell letters were
obtained as affording a vindication of his own collection.<a name="FNanchor_50_65" id="FNanchor_50_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_65" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> P. T. was
beforehand with him in citing the precedent to explain the means by
which his piratical volume was formed, and to justify its
publication.<a name="FNanchor_51_66" id="FNanchor_51_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_66" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The similarity of language and ideas in the mention of
the Wycherley letters was much more peculiar. Lord Oxford appears to
have refused to father the volume of 1729, for Pope never again alleged
that he sent it to the press. But neither did the poet avow that he
himself was responsible for its appearance. On the contrary, he renewed
the false statement that the letters were not printed till after they
were deposited in Lord Oxford's library, and spoke indefinitely of the
agency through which they were given to the world. "It happened soon
after," he says in his Narrative, "that the posthumous works of Mr.
Wycherley were published in such a manner as could no way increase the
reputation of that gentleman, who had been Mr. Pope's first
correspondent and friend; and several of these letters so fully showed
the state of that case that it was thought but justice to Mr.
Wycherley's memory to print a few to discredit that imposition."<a name="FNanchor_52_67" id="FNanchor_52_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_67" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
"The next year," he says, in the preface to the quarto of 1737, "the
posthumous works of Mr. Wycherley were printed in a way disreputable
enough to his memory. It was thought a justice due to him, to show the
world his better judgment, and that it was his last resolution to have
suppressed those poems. As some of the letters which had passed between
him and our author cleared that point, they were published in 1729, with
a few marginal notes added by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span> friend."<a name="FNanchor_53_68" id="FNanchor_53_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_68" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> "The letters to Mr.
Wycherley," says P. T.'s address to the reader, "were procured some
years since on account of a surreptitious edition of his posthumous
works. As those letters showed the true state of that case, the
publication of them was doing the best justice to the memory of Mr.
Wycherley."<a name="FNanchor_54_69" id="FNanchor_54_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_69" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Pope misrepresented the tenor of the letters as an
excuse for divulging them; but how came the vindictive P. T. to be the
first to hit upon an untruth in which he had no sort of interest, and to
serve the cause of his antagonist by promulgating the fanciful
description? Pope ascribed the publication to an indefinite agency, to
avoid acknowledging that he was the sole originator of the work; but how
came his enemy P. T. to anticipate his wishes, and the ambiguous
phraseology in which he conveyed them? The identity of thought and
expression was the more singular that P. T., in a private communication
to Curll, had confirmed the original story of the poet, and asserted
that "a noble lord had handed to the press the letters of
Wycherley."<a name="FNanchor_55_70" id="FNanchor_55_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_70" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> To the world he varied the tale, and the variation was
the same which was adopted a week or two afterwards by Pope.</p>

<p>A coincidence remains which more than all the rest proclaims Pope to be
the author of the address "to the reader." Nothing would have served
better his purpose in the prosecution than to prevail upon Curll to
confess that the letters were of his own procuring and printing. Upon
the seizure of the books Smythe wrote to him in the name of P. T.,
promising that he should have the work upon easier terms, and holding
out the prospect of a second and more important volume of correspondence
if he would keep secret the whole transaction, would assert that he had
the letters from different hands, and avow that he had printed them, as
he did Cromwell's before.<a name="FNanchor_56_71" id="FNanchor_56_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_71" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The preface, which had never been seen by
Curll, and which was appended, as if in anticipation of the event, to
all the copies carried off to the House of Lords,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span> contained the same
tale he was instructed to tell. "The collection," it said, "hath been
owing to several cabinets, some drawn from thence by accidents, and
others, even of those to ladies, voluntarily given. It is to one of that
sex we are beholden for the whole correspondence with H. C[romwell]
Esq., which letters being lent her by that gentleman she took the
liberty to print." On the 12th of May, the day the work was published,
Pope gave a similar account to Caryll of the mode by which the contents
were procured. "What," he said, "makes me sick of writing is the
shameless industry of such fellows as Curll, and the idle ostentation,
or weak partiality of many of my correspondents, who have shown about my
letters (which I never writ but in haste, and generally against the
grain, in mere civility; for almost all letters are impertinent further
than <i>Si vales, bene est; ego valeo</i>) to such a degree that a volume of
two hundred or more are printed by that rascal. But he could never have
injured me this way, had not my friends furnished him with the occasion,
by keeping such wretched papers as they ought to have burned." The whole
of this passage is an egregious specimen of misrepresentation and
hypocrisy. A glance at the work must have revealed to Pope that the new
letters it contained were those which had been returned to him,&mdash;the
letters to Gay, Digby, Blount, and Caryll; that it comprised letters
<i>to</i> as well as <i>from</i> him,<a name="FNanchor_57_72" id="FNanchor_57_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_72" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>&mdash;letters of which he was the sole
depositary; that the text was not taken from the originals, but from the
copy he had amended and re-cast; and that it was, therefore, impossible
that his acquaintances should have furnished materials which could only
have been derived from one source,&mdash;the bound book in the Oxford
library. His pretence that his letters were hasty and insignificant
expressions of civility, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span> had spared no pains in collecting and
editing them; his affected indignation at his friends "for keeping such
wretched papers as they ought to have burned," when he himself had
preserved them in duplicate, and designed them for publication; his
transparent fiction that almost the entire circle of his
correspondents,&mdash;Addison, Steele, Congreve, Gay, Walsh, Trumbull,
Craggs, Digby, Blount, and others,&mdash;had been guilty of "idle ostentation
or weak partiality," in showing these "wretched papers" to somebody who
transcribed them for the press,&mdash;are all so many additional arguments to
show the conscious guilt of Pope, and the gross and clumsy inventions by
which he endeavoured to divert suspicion. The fable he concocted is, in
its essential circumstance, identical with the fabulous story of P. T.
While P. T. on his part is telling a falsehood to the public in the
preface, and begging the bookseller to tell it in the House of Lords,
Pope on his own behalf is telling the same falsehood in private to
Caryll. This concurrence of misrepresentation between the letter of the
poet, and P. T.'s address "to the reader" and instructions to Curll,
could not have proceeded from independent and hostile persons.</p>

<p>Curll did not choose, when he was before the Committee of the House of
Lords, to father the lie which had been suggested to him. The
proceedings were adjourned from the 14th to the 15th, that the clerk
might search through some more copies of the book for the missing letter
to Jervas, and P. T. employed the interval in again pressing Curll to
assume the entire responsibility of the work. He gently rebuked him for
owning that the books were sent by an unknown hand which might, he said,
"be thought shuffling, and induce inquiry and suspicion of some dark
transaction;" and he assured him that the lords would consider him more
sincere if he professed that he had the letters from different hands,
and had printed them himself.<a name="FNanchor_58_73" id="FNanchor_58_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_73" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Curll repudiated the notion of
evidencing his sincerity by deposing to a falsehood, and of silencing
inquiry and suspicion by pretending that he had procured a quantity of
manuscripts from a variety of persons whom he must have refused to name.
"My defence," he replied, "is right; I only told the Lords I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span> did not
know from whence the books came. This was strict truth and prevented all
further inquiry."<a name="FNanchor_59_74" id="FNanchor_59_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_74" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The pertinacity of P. T. in endeavouring to
persuade the bookseller to commit himself to a lie was as gratuitous as
it was shameless, for he had no interest in the deception he urged.
Curll had several weeks before announced to Pope that this mysterious
agent was the collector of the letters, and Pope in communicating the
intelligence to the public declared that he knew no such person. The
renewed mention of a couple of fanciful initials could not increase P.
T.'s risk of detection, any more than it could signify whether he had
sold the correspondence to Curll to be printed, or had printed it first
and sold it afterwards. But what would have been purposeless in P. T.
was important to Pope. The friends who had returned him the letters
which appeared in the volume must have joined with the public in
ascribing the work to him, and it was of the utmost moment that Curll
should absolve him from the imputation. Having entrapped his victim into
a false confession, he would have loudly appealed to it to prove that he
was not only innocent but injured. He would have complained to the
world, as he had done to Caryll, of the "idle ostentation and weak
partiality" which had caused his hasty and artless letters to be
printed, and his vanity would have been doubly gratified by the
appearance that his choicest compositions were the careless scratchings
of his pen, and that the personal and literary merits they displayed had
been forced into day to the grievous annoyance of his reluctant modesty.</p>

<p>Every incident which arose in the progress of the controversy
strengthened the case against Pope. At the same time that Smythe, on the
behalf of P. T., exhorted Curll to give false evidence before the House
of Lords, he informed the bookseller of the method by which a portion of
the correspondence had been acquired. P. T. had been engaged with a
noble friend of Mr. Pope in preparing for the press the letters of
Wycherley, and had caused some extra copies to be struck off. These, he
said, "put into his head the thought of collecting more," and when he
printed the materials he had since accumulated he imitated as closely as
possible the type and paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span> of the stored up sheets.<a name="FNanchor_60_75" id="FNanchor_60_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_75" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> P. T. made a
merit of the revelation, and wished that Curll should see in it a proof
of the openness and confidence with which he was treated. In reality it
was an endeavour to explain the awkward circumstance that the prose part
of Pope's Wycherley had been done up with the letters of 1735. The
publication of 1729 was entitled the second volume of Wycherley's
"Posthumous Works," and contained a couple of notes referring to poems
which were inserted or omitted in what was called "the present edition."
But as Pope's letters were not an edition of Wycherley's Works, the
absurdity of the reference might have led at any moment to the exposure
of the fact that the sheets of the old book had been transferred to the
new, and it was better at once, by an air of candid confession, to
account for the importation than to run the risk of discovery. Curll had
soon a rival version to give of the manner in which these sheets were
procured. He announced that Gilliver, who published the Wycherley volume
of 1729, had declared that Pope bought of him the remainder of the
impression, consisting of six hundred copies, and directed the other
letters comprised in the volume of 1735 to be printed to match them.<a name="FNanchor_61_76" id="FNanchor_61_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_76" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
There can be no difficulty in deciding between these opposite
statements. The assertion of P. T. we know to be a falsehood, for Pope
himself, and not the noble friend, prepared the letters of Wycherley for
the press. None of the inferior agents could have carried off any large
number of books, without detection, nor could have stowed them away from
1729 to 1735. The motive to thieve what was already published could only
have been lucre, and yet thirty pounds were taken for three hundred
octavos of 470<a name="FNanchor_62_77" id="FNanchor_62_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_77" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> pages each, when but 50 of these pages were derived
from the sheets that cost nothing. If, too, there was any truth in P.
T.'s story, he was encumbered with the pile of stolen goods when he
opened the correspondence with Curll in 1733, whereas it is clear from
his communications at that time that the idea of supplying printed books
had not then occurred to him. The trick which had been practised was
known to Pope when he put forth his "Narrative," and he might have
obtained a clue to the culprit by an investigation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span> at the
printing-office. He nevertheless made no comments on the subject, nor,
loudly as he exclaimed against the abstraction of his letters, did he
breathe a whisper against the abstraction of the sheets of the
Wycherley. Not a single specimen, again, of the work of 1729 is now
known to exist, which is in some degree explained by its absorption into
the volume of 1735; but, on the supposition that the sheets transferred
to that volume were merely extra copies, struck off secretly for P. T.,
there is no reason why the Wycherley of 1729 should have disappeared.
The conflicting statement of Curll is not embarrassed by any of these
difficulties, and was never denied by either Gilliver or Pope, which is
of itself sufficient to establish its truth, when we bear in mind that,
instead of confronting calumny with silence, the poet denounced every
charge he could repel.</p>

<p>The letter urging Curll anew to make a false statement of the means by
which he obtained the correspondence, was received by him on the morning
of May 15. "I am," he said, in his reply, "just again going to the Lords
to finish Pope."<a name="FNanchor_63_78" id="FNanchor_63_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_78" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He verified his boast. In place of adopting the
advice of P. T., he showed the letter which contained it.<a name="FNanchor_64_79" id="FNanchor_64_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_79" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Pope's
double dealing had been strongly suspected on the previous day, when it
was discovered that the copies seized had been altered in anticipation
of the charge he preferred. There was now a second coincidence to
connect him with the plot. The letter produced by Curll revealed that
the correspondence had been taken from the archives of Lord Oxford, and
that the story Pope had volunteered to Caryll, and which he undoubtedly
reiterated to his friends among the Lords, was not only an invention to
conceal the truth, but the same invention which P. T. exhorted the
bookseller to adopt. Some step was necessary to save the poet from
discomfiture. He therefore put forth an advertisement in the "Daily
Post-boy," acknowledging, what he was no longer able to deny, that "some
of the letters could only be procured from his own library, or that of a
noble Lord," and promising twenty guineas to either Smythe or P. T. if
they would "discover the whole affair," and forty guineas if they "could
prove that they had acted by the direction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span> any other person."<a name="FNanchor_65_80" id="FNanchor_65_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_80" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
This was an old device of the poet. To escape from the obloquy he
incurred by an impious and indecent parody of the First Psalm, he
inserted an advertisement in the "Postman," offering a reward of three
guineas for the discovery of the person who sent it to the press. The
publisher, Mrs. Burleigh, declared that she possessed the manuscript in
his own handwriting, and expressed her readiness to produce it, but he
never ventured to accept the challenge or to contradict her
assertion.<a name="FNanchor_66_81" id="FNanchor_66_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_81" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Pope did not acknowledge that the essence of a falsehood
was in the deceit. "If you have seen a late advertisement," he wrote to
Miss Blount, August 7, 1716, alluding probably to this transaction, "you
will know that I have not told a lie, which we both abominate, but
equivocated pretty genteelly." Without in strict language disclaiming
the authorship, he intended that the reader should understand it as a
disclaimer. His advertisement respecting the letters was a kindred case.
He meant it to be received as a denial of all connivance at the
publication of his correspondence, and in strict language he denied
nothing. He said that the book was printed by P. T., in combination with
Smythe, which was equally true, if P. T. was Pope. He could use the
phrase "<i>some</i> of the letters," when driven to confess that they were
procured from the library of Lord Oxford, because the volume contained
the Cromwell and Wycherley letters, which had been printed before. He
could hold out the bait of rewards to himself without any risk of
betrayal, and the man&oelig;uvre must have been adopted in concert with his
accomplice Smythe, upon whose secresy and fidelity he was already
dependent.</p>

<p>The Committee of the Lords reported that there was not a letter from any
peer in the work, and since no law had been infringed, they recommended
that the seized copies should be restored.<a name="FNanchor_67_82" id="FNanchor_67_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_82" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Motte, the bookseller,
writing to Swift in July 31, 1735, says, that when Curll was before the
House, "he was ruffled for the publication in a manner as, to a man of
less impudence than his own, would have been very uneasy." With whatever
virulence he may have been attacked by the partisans of the poet, he was
invulnerable from his want of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span> character as well as from his want of
shame, and he had the gratification of inflicting wounds he could not
receive. "Pope," he said to the Lords, "has a knack of versifying, but
in prose I think myself a match for him."<a name="FNanchor_68_83" id="FNanchor_68_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_83" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He afterwards boasted that
he had not only vindicated his assertion, but that he might affirm "with
regard to all the attacks made upon him by the petulant little
gentleman,&mdash;<i>veni, vidi, vici</i>."<a name="FNanchor_69_84" id="FNanchor_69_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_84" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> His ally, P. T., derived no
satisfaction from this victory over their common antagonist. Curll had
proved a less ready dupe than had been anticipated, and his insidious
prompter reproached him for his adherence to the truth. Smythe informed
him that P. T. was out of humour with him for not "owning the printing"
at his final attendance before the Committee of the House of Lords; that
he had probably by his wilfulness lost a future copyright of immense
value, and that his imperfect sheets would not be completed, nor
additional books supplied, unless he paid twenty pounds in advance.<a name="FNanchor_70_85" id="FNanchor_70_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_85" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The reply of Curll was lofty and defiant. He said he cared nothing for
any man's ill-humour; that he would never stoop to own a fact of which
he was innocent; that he had acted justly, which was what he should
always think wisely; that he despised the future copyright of which
hopes were held out to him; that he would have no more dealings with
such dark suspicious characters, and that unless he was frankly and
fairly treated, he would print all the letters he had received from
them.<a name="FNanchor_71_86" id="FNanchor_71_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_86" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> P. T. had previously stipulated that his letters should be
given up to him,<a name="FNanchor_72_87" id="FNanchor_72_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_87" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> but Curll had the precaution to take copies before
he returned the originals, and, to avoid cavil, he stated that he would
make an affidavit of their accuracy. The effect of the threat showed the
alarm it excited. Smythe completely changed his tone. He no longer
prefers complaints against Curll, nor exacts conditions. He is his
friend and servant, and will bring him the remainder of the impression
on Thursday. He professes to be tired with the caprice of P. T. and has
hardly written the words when he announces that he has been sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span> for by
him, and hears from the messenger that he is in good humour.<a name="FNanchor_73_88" id="FNanchor_73_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_88" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Though
P. T. was awed, Curll no longer trusted him, and before Thursday came
the bookseller had advertised what he called, from the signature of the
chief conspirator, the "Initial Correspondence."<a name="FNanchor_74_89" id="FNanchor_74_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_89" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>P. T. and Smythe put forth a counter-advertisement on the 23rd of May,
in which they declared that they would retaliate by committing to the
press the letters of Curll.<a name="FNanchor_75_90" id="FNanchor_75_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_90" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The ostensible motive of the mock
clergyman and his employer was to cover the bookseller with infamy. The
effect, they said, will be, "to open a scene of baseness and
foul-dealing that will sufficiently show to mankind his character and
conduct." The correspondence does not bear out this description. The
documents show that the lying and trickery rested with P. T., while the
bookseller was veracious in his assertions and straight-forward in his
proceedings. "That Curll," says Johnson, "gave a true account of the
transaction it is reasonable to believe, because no falsehood was ever
detected."<a name="FNanchor_76_91" id="FNanchor_76_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_91" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It was his boast that falsehood had been his abhorrence
throughout the discussion, and he drew vaunting comparisons between
Pope's addiction to the vice, and his own detestation of it.<a name="FNanchor_77_92" id="FNanchor_77_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_92" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> His
very failings in one direction had helped to sustain his virtue in
another. He had too much effrontery to care to descend to duplicity, and
it is impossible to read his many controversial manifestoes without
perceiving that he was in general as truthful as he was impudent. In the
instance of Pope's letters, there is the original blot, that he saw no
discredit in publishing papers which he supposed to be purloined; but he
had already avowed the fact before the House of Lords, and the crime was
more than shared by P. T. In everything else the acts and language of
the bookseller contrast favourably with the meanness and falsehoods of
his correspondent, who would not have assisted to disseminate the record
of his own misdeeds. But it was different with the poet. He must have
seen that the inevitable tendency of the "Initial Correspondence"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span> would
be to convict him of the offences he had tried to fasten upon Curll. His
single chance of diminishing its disastrous effect was to promulgate it
as evidence upon his own side, and not to allow it to come forth solely
as the hostile statement of an opponent. The proceeding in P. T. would
have been to aid in propagating the proofs of P. T.'s "baseness and
foul-dealing." In Pope it was an effort to throw upon the initials the
stigma which would otherwise have fallen upon Pope himself.</p>

<p>The resolution of P. T. to proclaim his own disgrace was less
extraordinary than his manner of doing it. It was announced on the 24th
of May, that "the clergyman concerned with P. T. and Edmund Curll to
publish Mr. Pope's letters hath discovered the whole transaction, and a
narrative of the same will be speedily printed."<a name="FNanchor_78_93" id="FNanchor_78_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_93" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Hence it appears
that Smythe had made a full confession to the author of the "Narrative,"
and P. T. must be presumed to have been a party to it, since he
transmitted the originals of the communications he had addressed to
Curll, together with Curll's replies. This "Narrative" was the work of
Pope. He alone could have furnished several of the particulars, together
with the letter which Curll wrote to him in March, 1735; and the
statements, the misrepresentations,<a name="FNanchor_79_94" id="FNanchor_79_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_94" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the reflections, and sometimes
the words, are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span> same which he employed in the preface to the quarto
of 1737. Hitherto, P. T. had been so fearful of detection by the poet,
that in the language of Smythe, he suspected his own shadow. He now
unmasked himself without a motive, and without reserve, to the man he
had injured. He had nothing to tell of Curll but what Curll had insisted
upon relating before the House of Lords, and the only novel information
he could give was the details of his own thefts and frauds. This,
indeed, was what Pope would chiefly have cared to learn. He would have
been eager to ascertain who the person could be that had got access to
his letters, and the means by which they were copied and printed; and he
certainly would not have called anything "a discovery of the <i>whole</i>
transaction," which contained no revelation upon the only points of the
least importance. But it is extremely improbable that the wary P. T.
should have wantonly turned self-accuser. To the last this fabulous
personage continued to act in the manner which was most convenient to
Pope, and the true explanation of the pretended confession is, that it
was a fiction of the poet to account for his possession of the
correspondence with Curll.</p>

<p>More inexplicable than all was the forbearance of Pope to produce the
facts in his "Narrative." He might feel bound to suppress the names of
culprits who had volunteered a confession of their crime; but he might
have told the manner of the theft, and specified the printer employed by
P. T. He refrained, on the contrary, from revealing the particulars
which would have absolved him from an odious imputation. He kept back
every tittle of evidence which would have acquitted him if he was
innocent, and have implicated him if he was guilty. His story has none
of the circumstantiality of an actual occurrence; his statements are as
indefinite as the agents were shadowy. He disclosed the dealings of P.
T. with Curll, which Curll had noised abroad, and was about to publish,
but he does not bestow a thought upon the far more essential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span> question
of the mode in which the correspondence was purloined, and seems to be
satisfied himself, and wishes that the world should be satisfied
likewise, with learning that a person, whose only designation was a
couple of initials, sent the letters ready printed to the bookseller.
Obliged to abandon his original story of the means by which they found
their way to the press, Pope had now some powerful reason for diverting
attention from the subject, and leaving the mystery unexplained.</p>

<p>He speedily manifested his desire to consign P. T. to oblivion, and
reverted to his former scheme of imputing the publication to Curll. In
the very "Narrative" which showed that the bookseller had no share in
gathering together the correspondence, Pope inculcated the idea that he
had been active in the task. He charged him with having put forth an
advertisement of the letters to Cromwell, in which "he promised
encouragement to all persons who should send him more," and adds, a
little lower down, "By these honest means Mr. Curll went on increasing
his collection."<a name="FNanchor_80_95" id="FNanchor_80_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_95" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The accused challenged him to produce the
advertisement, and the accuser was silent. He persevered nevertheless in
misrepresenting to his acquaintances Curll's part in the business.
Writing to Fortescue, on March 26, 1736, of the volume of 1735, he calls
it "the book of letters which Curll printed and spared not," though the
poet's own witnesses, P. T. and Smythe, had demonstrated, even in their
anger against Curll, that he had nothing to do with procuring or
printing the letters, and was merely the vendor of the copies he had
bought. In Pope's complaints to his other friends, Curll is the single
culprit to whom he ascribed the injury he had suffered, and on no one
occasion did he go through the form of keeping up his P. T. fiction. His
misrepresentations to the world at large were more covertly expressed.
He spoke in his authorised edition of the "publisher's own accounts in
his prefaces," and, as his first example, quotes P. T.'s address "to the
reader," which he knew from the letters of Smythe had never been seen by
the publisher till it was shown him at the bar of the House of Lords. To
help out the mis-statement in the text his reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span> in a note is made
to Curll's reprint of the collection of 1735, instead of to the volume
in which the address "to the reader" was originally produced.<a name="FNanchor_81_96" id="FNanchor_81_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_96" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Nor
was it, perhaps, without design that in the catalogue of surreptitious
editions, prefixed to an octavo impression of his letters which appeared
in 1737, he put first in the list, as if it had been the parent of the
rest, an edition of Curll, which was taken from the volume of P. T., and
allotted the second place to the primitive text. He never revived the
clumsy fabrication he had been compelled to promulgate in his
"Narrative." In private he transferred the crimes of P. T. to Curll; in
public he insinuated what he dared not assert for fear of retaliation;
but neither in public nor private was anything heard of the phantom who
had purloined, printed, and sold the correspondence. Had his existence
been real, or the invention been credited, Pope would not have persisted
in calumniating the bookseller for want of a culprit upon whom to lay
the offence.</p>

<p>Faulkner, the Dublin printer, told Dr. Birch, in 1749, that James
Worsdale was the person who went to Curll, by Pope's direction, in the
habit of a clergyman.<a name="FNanchor_82_97" id="FNanchor_82_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_97" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Before the entry in Birch's diary was
published, Dr. Johnson had given the same account in his "Lives of the
Poets."<a name="FNanchor_83_98" id="FNanchor_83_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_98" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Worsdale was a painter, dramatist, and actor, and, as if his
triple calling was insufficient for his versatile disposition, he
followed a fourth, and was hired, Johnson says, to conduct clandestine
negotiations. When an attempt was made to extort money from the second
son of Sir Robert Walpole, he was engaged to mix with the conspirators,
to win their confidence, and to betray it. They were convicted of the
fraud, and Worsdale, in giving his evidence, "acted with so much life
and spirit the several parts he had performed during the time of sifting
out the mystery as gave no small diversion to the court."<a name="FNanchor_84_99" id="FNanchor_84_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_99" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> According
to Horace Walpole, the poet had employed this personator and detector of
rogues in his more reputable capacity, to make several copies of a
portrait of Atterbury.<a name="FNanchor_85_100" id="FNanchor_85_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_100" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> He seemed formed to carry on the traffic with
Curll, and since it was his profession to aid in plots, he might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span> be
expected to be a secret as well as a willing assistant. Johnson, who
attached some weight to his evidence, says he was of doubtful
veracity,&mdash;an objection which would have applied to the disclosures of
any representative of Smythe; for no upright man would have played a
part in a scheme of deception. His assertion would have been worthless,
if it had stood alone; but it at least falls in with the numerous
circumstances which all conjoin to criminate Pope.</p>

<p>If his impatience to print the Wycherley correspondence renders it
probable that he would be anxious to print the more important collection
which he had sedulously prepared for the press; if the deception he
practised in 1729, to avoid being taxed with the proceeding, and to
throw it upon somebody else, favours the belief that he repeated the
deception in 1735 with the same intention; and if the various facts
connected with the publication unite to prove with accumulative force
that he was the sole contriver of it, there is the further argument that
no other person had the slightest interest in perpetrating the act. "The
numbers," says Dr. Johnson, "offered to sale by the private messengers,
showed that the hope of gain could not have been the motive to the
impression." Money was so little the object that a parcel of the books
was sent to Lintot, "for which no price was ever demanded, as he had
made known his resolution not to pay a porter, and consequently not to
deal with a nameless agent."<a name="FNanchor_86_101" id="FNanchor_86_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_101" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Any person in the employment of Lord
Oxford, who had access to the papers, and was competent to transcribe
them, would not have undergone the toil, and risked detection, disgrace,
and ruin for the sake of a few pounds which he must have shared with his
accomplice Smythe. The vaunted revenge of P. T. could not have been the
motive; for beyond the empty profession, it was belied alike by his
words and deeds. The poet in truth loved himself too well to be able to
counterfeit speciously the part of a hater. P. T. published the letters
which Pope meant to be published; he lauded Pope in Pope's own strain;
he took the measures which were most to Pope's advantage; he reflected
Pope's vanities, weaknesses, and falsehoods, and behaved throughout in a
manner as identical with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span> Pope's position as it was remote from his own.
Lucre and revenge were propensities to which P. T. was a stranger,
though he aspired to a reputation for the latter, and the only passion
apparent in his conduct is his mania to gratify by dishonesty and deceit
the literary ambition of Pope.</p>

<p>"The engineer was hoist with his own petard," and Curll, the intended
victim, had the satisfaction of being the executioner. The poet plainly
considered him to be a scoundrel whom he had a right to damage by any
means, foul or fair. Walter Scott believed that his inveterate
persecutor administered the emetic to him, and extraordinary as it may
seem that a celebrated man of letters should adopt this method of
punishing an obnoxious bookseller, the language of Pope obliges us to
accept the conclusion<a name="FNanchor_87_102" id="FNanchor_87_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_102" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. The trick was puerile and degrading, but it
inflicted no injury. The prosecution in the House of Lords, and the
subsequent effort to fasten his own misdeeds upon his enemy was an
outrage of a different description. To lure him into purchasing a book,
and then to employ the influence conferred by genius in founding charges
upon the act which were absolutely groundless, and in branding him with
the disgrace which belonged to his accuser, was a baseness of which the
lowest Grub-street scribbler satirised in the Dunciad would probably not
have been capable. A spirit of unfairness, which, bad as it might be,
was less injurious, pervaded his commercial dealings with Curll. The
bookseller paid ten pounds in money, and twenty pounds in promissory
notes, for three hundred copies of the work. Two hundred and forty only
were delivered, and of these one hundred and ninety wanted the letters
to Jervas, Digby, Blount, and others<a name="FNanchor_88_103" id="FNanchor_88_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_103" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. P. T. and Smythe stated in
their advertisement of May 23 that Curll's notes "had proved not
negotiable," which they seem to have designed as an excuse for not
completing the imperfect books<a name="FNanchor_89_104" id="FNanchor_89_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_104" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. Curll maintained that the defence
added slander to treachery; for the notes were not due till the 12th of
June, and he indignantly declared that they would be honoured if the
terms of the bargain were fulfilled<a name="FNanchor_90_105" id="FNanchor_90_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_105" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. But these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span> terms were never
intended to be performed. Smythe had contracted to reserve the whole
impression for Curll, and assured him on May 10 that no one else should
sell a single copy.<a name="FNanchor_91_106" id="FNanchor_91_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_106" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The pledge was violated as soon as made by
sending a parcel of the books to Lintot, and one of the artifices which
marked every part of the transaction was employed in public to
counteract the promises which had been given in private. As Curll was to
provide his own title-page and preface, and the copies seized by the
order of the House of Lords had a title-page and preface by P. T.,
Smythe wrote to Curll on the 13th of May to explain this departure from
the arrangement. A "wonderful caution" had suddenly seized P. T., who,
apprehending that an injunction might be obtained in Chancery against
Curll, had furnished a preface which "threw the publication entirely off
him," and a title-page, in which, substituting the entire trade for an
individual, it was said that the volume was "printed and sold by the
booksellers of London and Westminster."<a name="FNanchor_92_107" id="FNanchor_92_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_107" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This was pronounced by
Smythe to be "as lucky as could be," and it was certainly a curious
piece of fortune which caused P. T. to transmit the fifty early copies
without title or preface, and inspired him immediately afterwards to
attach both to the copies which were instantly to be pounced upon by a
messenger from the Lords. To deceive Curll by promises was the first end
to be attained, and he was led to believe that he would have a monopoly
of the work. To deprive him of the advantages he imagined he had secured
was a second, though a subordinate object of the conspiracy. The whole
corporation of booksellers were to be invited to encroach upon his
rights, and the preface and title-page affixed to the copies produced at
the bar of the House of Lords had been drawn up with the secret purpose
of contradicting any claim which might be set up by Curll. When Smythe
wrote his deceptive explanation of the motives of P. T., these
confederates were endeavouring to coax their dupe into owning that he
was the collector of the letters, and it was necessary that he should
still be humoured and beguiled. When the mask was thrown off, P. T. and
Smythe joined in the declaration that they had neither of them "given or
could pretend to give any title<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span> whatever to Mr. Pope's letters to
Curll," and they promised "that every bookseller should be indemnified
every way from any possible prosecution or molestation of the said
Curll."<a name="FNanchor_93_108" id="FNanchor_93_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_108" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This invitation to all the world to republish the
correspondence of Pope was advertised in the newspapers, and the poet
shortly afterwards reprinted it in his "Narrative" without a word of
direct remonstrance against the pretension to dispose of his property.
P. T. had always hitherto adopted the course which furthered the
projects of Pope, and Pope, in return, appeared to smile upon the
enormous prerogative to make a general grant of his correspondence which
had been assumed by P. T. Commercial honesty was not to be expected in a
plan which was based upon falsehood and calumny; but if an ordinary
tradesman had conducted his dealings in the same manner as Pope, his
custom and character would have been destroyed. The events which
followed the publication lead to the same conclusion with the incidents
which preceded and attended it. Pope stated in his "Narrative" that
there were so many omissions and interpolations in the surreptitious
volume, that it was impossible for him to own the contents in their
present condition.<a name="FNanchor_94_109" id="FNanchor_94_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_109" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In two distinct advertisements which he put forth
in May and July, 1735, he went further, and declared that some of the
letters were not his at all.<a name="FNanchor_95_110" id="FNanchor_95_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_110" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Nevertheless the bookseller, Cooper,
with whom he was now in alliance, reprinted the entire collection, and
brought it out on the 12th of June. He at the same time announced that
his edition had been entered at Stationers' Hall, according to the Act
of Queen Anne, and that "Edmund Curll or any other pirater of the book
should be prosecuted." Curll then served upon him a process, the purport
of which does not appear, and Pope wrote to his friend and counsel
Fortescue, who a few months later was raised to the bench, and informed
him that he had bid Cooper send him the document for his legal opinion,
begged to be acquainted with the steps which were necessary to be taken,
and acknowledged that he had connived at Cooper's publication. In a
subsequent note he asks for further directions in the conduct of the
case. The poet and the bookseller were therefore working in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>
conjunction, or to speak more correctly, the bookseller was the agent of
the poet. It must have been by Pope's authority that he appropriated the
copyright of the letters, and threatened proceedings against any one who
invaded it. When Curll took up the gauntlet Pope adopted the cause,
engaged Fortescue in the defence, and carried on with him the
correspondence respecting it. His sanction of the publication is
confirmed by the catalogue of surreptitious editions, since this
impression of Cooper is omitted from the list, notwithstanding the
insertion of a later impression by the same bookseller, containing some
slight additions that had not been ordered by Pope. Thus while the poet
pretended that he could not own the P. T. collection, with its
mutilated, interpolated, and forged letters, he had secretly authorised
a reprint which was identical with the collection he denounced. His
actions evince the insincerity of his words. He had the power to erase
the forgeries and interpolations with a stroke of his pen, and unless he
had approved of the book in its primitive state he would not have
entered into a league with Cooper to produce it unaltered. He afterwards
seemed to disclaim the republication he had espoused. In the preface to
his avowed edition in 1737, he spoke of the "piratical printers" of the
surreptitious editions, without making any exception, and said that
there was "not one of them to whom he had ever given the least title, or
any other encouragement than that of not prosecuting them." This was
either a direct untruth or, what was more in accordance with his
peculiar morality, a deceptive quibble. Though he knew that his readers
must infer that the epithet "piratical" was applied to all the printers
who had put forth an edition of the volume of 1735, he may yet have
justified to himself the assertion that he had never given the least
title to any of them, by the reflection that as he had given a title to
Cooper he was not a piratical printer.</p>

<p>While the inquiry was going on before the House of Lords in May, Smythe
impressed upon Curll that P. T. had his whole heart set upon the
publication of the letters, not so much on account of the volume which
had been seized, as because it was the precursor of a much more
important correspondence with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span> Swift, the late Lord Oxford, the Bishop
of Rochester, and Lord Bolingbroke.<a name="FNanchor_96_111" id="FNanchor_96_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_111" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> When P. T. disappeared from the
scene, Pope is found to have inherited his ideas and to be animated by
the desire to complete the schemes his enemy left unfulfilled. "Since I
saw you," he wrote to Lord Oxford, June 17, 1735, "I have learnt of an
excellent machine of Curll's, or rather his director's, to engraft a lie
upon, to make me seem more concerned than I was in the affair of the
letters. It is so artful an one that I longed to tell it you&mdash;not that I
will enter into any controversy with such a dog. But I believe it will
occasion a thing you will not be sorry for relating to the Bishop of
Rochester's letters and papers." There are no further particulars to
explain in what degree Pope had acknowledged to Lord Oxford that he was
"concerned in the affair of the letters,"<a name="FNanchor_97_112" id="FNanchor_97_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_112" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> nor does any record remain
of the artful device of Curll, or of the new director who had succeeded
to P. T. and Smythe. The want of all foundation for the allegations
against the bookseller is probably the cause of the vagueness of the
allusions. The single palpable circumstance is that, in spite of his
lamentations at the publication of his letters, Pope was already
designing to send a fresh instalment of them to the press. Whatever may
have been the "excellent machine" to which he darkly referred, Curll had
furnished him with the pretence he sought. The bookseller put forth a
new edition of the printed copies he purchased from P. T., and called it
the first volume of "Mr. Pope's Literary Correspondence." Partly,
perhaps, to vex Pope, and partly to attract purchasers, he affixed the
same title to future volumes, which were principally a medley of trash
that had no relation to the poet. Among the promised contents of the
second volume were "Atterbury's Letters to Mr. Pope." Pope cited the
announcement as a reason for publishing his correspondence with the
bishop, which P. T. had enumerated among "the much more important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>
correspondence" that was intended to follow, and which, the poet, in
precise agreement with him, declared was "of a nature less
insignificant" than the printed collection.<a name="FNanchor_98_113" id="FNanchor_98_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_113" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The coincidence of
opinion between these bitter antagonists is especially remarkable,
because others have not been struck with the superiority of the letters
of Atterbury. Mr. Croker thought them, with one or two exceptions, dull,
pedantic, and common-place, and Warton complains that they are, many of
them, crowded to affectation with trite quotations from Horace and
Virgil. The excuse for making them public was weak in the extreme. On
the 12th of June Cooper replied to Curll's advertisement of his second
volume by a counter-advertisement, and offered him ten pounds for any
letter of Atterbury to Pope, or of Pope to Atterbury, of which he could
produce the original or a voucher. P. T.'s copy, if it existed, must
have been demanded when he made his confession, and it is among the
circumstances which show this confession to have been a fiction, that
the poet in his Narrative omitted to mention the surrender of the
important transcript, and never subsequently alluded to its existence.
Without copies or originals Curll could not violate the secrecy for
which Pope affected to be anxious. The poet, in fact, did not put forth
his pretence for printing the correspondence till he had received
practical evidence of the poverty of the bookseller's resources. Curll's
volume was published on the 14th of July,<a name="FNanchor_99_114" id="FNanchor_99_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_114" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and Pope's advertisement
did not come out till the following day. It was drawn up on the
13th,<a name="FNanchor_100_115" id="FNanchor_100_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_115" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> when he had probably seen an early copy of the book, or he
would have waited till the next morning, when he could have read in
conjunction with the rest of the public the letters which Atterbury was
alleged to have written to him. They were three in number. The longest
was a statement printed by the bishop, and addressed to the entire
world, refuting a charge of having corrupted the manuscript of
Clarendon's History. The remaining two were pronounced by Pope to be
forgeries, and of these one had already appeared in a Biographical
Dictionary,<a name="FNanchor_101_116" id="FNanchor_101_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_116" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and the other consisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span> chiefly of poetical
quotations. Not a line had oozed out from his private papers, and the
argument for divulging them was gone. A man who was eager to drag them
into day might use the incident as a pretext, but anybody who did not
court publicity would have left them in their obscurity upon the
discovery that they continued safe from prying eyes and transcribing
fingers. Pope's practice and professions were as usual at variance. He
raised a cry of distress at the publication of his letters by P. T., and
laid hold of the first hollow excuse for completing the obnoxious
design, and spreading before the world that portion of his
correspondence which P. T. had been unable to smuggle into print, in
consequence of Curll's unexpected revelation of the plot.</p>

<p>Pope stated in his advertisement, that along with his correspondence
with the Bishop of Rochester he should publish such of the letters as
were genuine from the surreptitious volume, and added, that the work
would be printed "with all convenient speed."<a name="FNanchor_102_117" id="FNanchor_102_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_117" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> But speed was not
convenient. The project slept till March 26, 1736, when he writes to
Fortescue, "Your too partial mention of the book of letters, with all
its faults and follies, which Curll printed and spared not (nor yet will
spare, for he has published a fourth sham volume yesterday), makes me
think it may not be amiss to send you&mdash;what I know you will be much more
pleased with than I can be&mdash;a proposal for a correct edition of them,
which at last I find must be offered, since people have misunderstood an
advertisement I printed some time ago, merely to put some stop to that
rascal's books, as a promise that I would publish such a book." His
excuse for the delay in redeeming his pledge of supplying an authentic
edition, is a curious instance of the absurdity to which a man of genius
may be reduced, when, unable to divulge his true reasons, he has
recourse to invention. "People" could not have "<i>misunderstood</i>" the
advertisement as "a promise that he would publish such a book," for the
promise was distinct, and there was no room left for misunderstanding in
the matter. But if we allow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span> that an advertisement in the newspapers,
asserting that he was under a necessity of putting out a genuine
edition, which would be printed with all convenient speed, was only
designed to be read as a threat for the purpose of stopping Curll's
trade, it is plain that Curll must have become acquainted with an
interpretation which was apparent to the rest of the world, and would
have paid no attention to a menace that was not intended to be executed.
Unless Pope desired that the public should believe he was serious, the
whole proceeding was objectless. He was long in learning the
misconstruction which had been put upon his words. While the
announcement was fresh, and likely to have been a topic of conversation,
he remained completely passive, and it was not till after an interval of
more than eight months that he discovered he was supposed to have given
a pledge, and must immediately redeem it. He had forgotten that he had
betrayed to Fortescue that he was in earnest at the time the
advertisement appeared. On August 2, 1735, a fortnight after it was
issued, Pope wrote to him, and asked to have back his letters; "for,"
said he, "I find my collection, such as it is, must be hastened, or will
not be so effectual." It had not yet occurred to him to maintain that
his promised publication was a feint. The true cause of his
procrastination has been suggested by the critic in the Athen&aelig;um. He had
distributed portions of his extensive correspondence with Caryll among
other groups, and addressed several of the letters to men of higher
position or greater fame. He must have rejected the fictitious compound
from his genuine edition, or waited till Caryll, who was sinking with
age and illness, was in his grave. The latter was the course which Pope
preferred. His friend was no doubt dying at the close of March, 1736,
and on the 6th of April he expired. With him disappeared the sole
difficulty which stood in the way of the new edition, and the poet from
that moment was active in its prosecution.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe the indifference and distaste which Pope
feigned for an undertaking that was entirely within his own discretion.
He began by announcing that the work would be printed with speed. He
then protested he did not mean what he said, and only yielded because
others had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span> erroneously inferred, that by advertising in the papers that
he would immediately print a book he intended to signify that a book
would be printed. He next resolved to publish by subscription, which was
a mode of levying forced contributions through the canvass of the author
and his friends. He hoped nevertheless that the subscription would fail,
in order that he might be excused from an act to which he had been
over-persuaded.<a name="FNanchor_103_118" id="FNanchor_103_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_118" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> His hope that support would be withheld had grown
to a belief when he wrote to Allen, on the 30th of April, and Allen, who
had sought his acquaintance from admiration of the benevolence and
goodness of heart which pervaded his letters, offered to bear the cost
of the impression. The public by their backwardness afforded Pope the
opportunity he professed to desire of dropping the work, but the
patronage of an individual was sufficient encouragement. He at once
replied that he would "not serve his private fame entirely at another's
expense," but that he would "accept the assistance in any moderate
degree," which meant that he would allow Allen to defray the outlay
which was in excess of the amount subscribed.<a name="FNanchor_104_119" id="FNanchor_104_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_119" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Time wore on, the
letters were three-quarters printed, and the subscribers were few.<a name="FNanchor_105_120" id="FNanchor_105_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_120" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
In his first receipts the poet had stated that if he did not proceed
with the book the money should be returned on demand after
midsummer.<a name="FNanchor_106_121" id="FNanchor_106_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_121" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The unwilling public pleaded the uncertainty as a reason
for not putting down their names. He admitted that the doubt they
expressed was a pretence, and informed Allen that to deprive them of the
pretext he had substituted receipts in which he promised to deliver the
volume by Lady Day.<a name="FNanchor_107_122" id="FNanchor_107_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_122" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> His object, he said, was to save Allen's purse.
The reluctance had ceased to be with the poet. He began by consenting to
print a book he would rather not have printed, that he might oblige the
world, and ended by compelling the world to subscribe to a book they
would rather not have purchased, that they might oblige Pope.</p>

<p>The subscription was a guinea for a quarto volume, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span> donation of
Allen, which Pope acknowledged in his will, was probably paid in part on
this occasion. The copyright was purchased by Dodsley,<a name="FNanchor_108_123" id="FNanchor_108_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_123" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and from
these united sources of emolument the book produced, as Johnson had
heard, "sufficient profit."<a name="FNanchor_109_124" id="FNanchor_109_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_124" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> It appeared on May 18, 1737, in folio
and quarto, and a little later in octavo, that the various sizes might
range with previous editions of the poet's works. In the preface he
enters into a history of the fate which had attended his letters, and of
the circumstances which compelled him to publish them, but with a
studious avoidance of every question which had been raised by the
collection of 1735. He says it is notorious what means have been taken
to procure his correspondence, and disposes of the single instance which
required explanation by enumerating among the methods "the transacting
with people who dealt without names in the dark." He says that several
letters have been ascribed to him which he did not write, and specifies
examples, none of which appeared in the book sold to Curll. He says that
the piratical editions contain various passages "which no man of common
sense would have printed himself," and this he could assert with truth,
because the greater part of the Cromwell series owed their publicity to
Mrs. Thomas alone. He declares that he had not authorised any of the
surreptitious impressions, but forbore to allege that the primitive
impression was surreptitious, and shunned all allusion to its birth and
parentage. He laments the need which exists for his own volume, and when
he proceeds "to state the case fairly in the present situation," none of
his reasons appertain to the work of P. T. He indulges in general
declamation upon the enormity of procuring letters by disreputable
contrivances, but carefully avoids affirming that any of those which
first saw the light in 1735 were obtained in the manner he deprecates.
He assures us, indeed, that his epistolary effusions are "emanations of
the heart, and not efforts of genius," and adds, "this alone may induce
any candid reader to believe their publication an act of necessity
rather than vanity," which honestly interpreted implies that he was not
the person who originally sent them to the press. The candid writer,
however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span> omitted to inform the candid reader of the pains he had taken
to render them worthy of his head as well as of his heart, and the
falsification of the premises destroys the credibility of the inference.
The silence of Pope upon the P. T. collection is, under the
circumstances, equivalent to a confession of guilt. He gives an account
of the surreptitious publication of his letters to Cromwell. He states
the reason of the publication of his letters to Wycherley. He reverts
once and again to what he justly called the sham volumes of Curll. He
records the minutest wrong he can detect in the execution of any of the
hostile schemes. But though the conduct of P. T. was the most flagrant
of all; though the poet was believed to be the contriver of the plot,
and his enemies taunted him with the fraud; though he professed to have
learnt the details of the mystery, and half a dozen sentences, if he was
innocent, would have set him right with both friends and foes; though
the collection of 1735 was in its nature and extent far more important
than the rest, and though it was the basis and primary cause of the
edition he was ushering into the world, he yet relates no particulars,
he offers no opinion, he ventures upon no denial. He endeavours instead
to mask his evasion of the subject, and tries to confound the main point
with subsidiary topics. There are wilful misrepresentations in his
preface, and he was not restrained in his language by his homage to
truth; but he had been baffled by the disclosures of Curll, and he was
afraid to risk specific assertions which had been already exposed.</p>

<p>His correspondence with Atterbury, and several other letters, were
printed for the first time in the avowed edition of Pope. He omitted as
well as added, and left out some of the letters to and from Wycherley,
some of the letters to and from Cromwell, some of the letters to ladies,
and a few scattered letters from the remaining groups. In the letters he
republished he here and there erased a sentence which had appeared in
the volume of 1735, or inserted a sentence which was new. The minuter
verbal alterations are numerous, but many of them are only corrections
of errors of the press. In all essential particulars the collection of
P. T., a little more sifted, is reproduced in the quarto of 1737. Pope
had profited in the interval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span> by the criticisms of the public. He set
aside the portions of his correspondence which were condemned, he
endeavoured to rectify the inconsistencies into which he had been
betrayed in its reconstruction, and he sometimes altered a word or a
phrase in the final revision to which he subjected the work. The changes
leave it apparent that the Pope text and the P. T. text are identical in
their origin, and neither of them are the text of the actual letters of
the poet. His selection affords an imperfect test of the parts which he
disowned as being counterfeited. He said in his advertisement of July
15, 1735, that he would reprint whatever was genuine in the
surreptitious editions; but he relinquished this design, and wrote to
Allen that "he was determined to leave out every syllable that could
give the least ill example to an age apt to take it, or the least
offence to any good or serious man."<a name="FNanchor_110_125" id="FNanchor_110_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_125" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> He accordingly stated in his
preface that he had not only omitted the letters which "were not his,"
but those which "were not approved of by him." Without committing
himself to an assertion which might be refuted, he probably wished to
obtain the benefit of the first alternative for letters which he had
rejected under the last. Nevertheless in his eagerness to particularise
any real forgery, he in effect accredited the entire collection of P. T.
He had far greater interest in showing that it was not authentic than in
damaging the trumpery volumes of Curll, and his forbearance to select a
single instance of imposition from its pages is a plain proof that none
existed for which he himself was not responsible. The charge of
interpolation, which he had twice put forth in his advertisements,<a name="FNanchor_111_126" id="FNanchor_111_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_126" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
and subsequently repeated to Allen,<a name="FNanchor_112_127" id="FNanchor_112_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_127" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> was still more openly
abandoned; for he tells us in his preface that the passages he omitted
were "improper, or at least impertinent to be divulged to the public,"
and he no longer pretended that they were any of them spurious. He did
not, in short, disown in his genuine edition one sentence of the volume
of 1735, but practically receded from his previous allegations, which
were mis-statements intended to persuade Caryll that he was not
answerable for the garbling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span> the letters, and the world that he was
not a party to their publication.</p>

<p>His acts continued to confirm his guilt. A little while after the quarto
was published there appeared the 5th and 6th volume of the octavo
edition of Pope's works, which the title-page says "consists of Letters,
wherein to those of the author's own edition are added all that are
genuine from the former impressions, with some never before
printed."<a name="FNanchor_113_128" id="FNanchor_113_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_128" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> This edition bears internal evidence of having been
printed concurrently with the quarto itself. A sheet signed *Dd, the
pages of which are numbered from 215 to 222, is interpolated in the
quarto between the two last leaves of Dd, and the numbers are of
necessity repeated on the succeeding eight pages. The interpolated
letters of the quarto are equally an interpolation in the octavo, where
they follow p. 116 of Vol. VI., on a duplicate half-sheet signed *I, and
the paging is repeated on the half-sheet which follows. Consequently the
octavo must have been struck off before the letters were interpolated in
the quarto, or they would not have been printed in the octavo on an
interpolated half-sheet. A second insertion tells the same tale. A few
letters are added at the end of the quarto with the announcement that
they had been published "since the foregoing sheets were printed off."
These letters appear in like manner at the end of the octavo after
<i>finis</i>. At the very moment, therefore, that Pope was compelling his
reluctant friends to subscribe to his expurgated quarto, he was
clandestinely printing an octavo edition in which he put back the whole
of the omitted letters he allowed to be genuine, and his imperfect
quarto was simply a fraud upon the purchasers for the purpose of
accrediting his feigned reprobation of the P. T. volume.</p>

<p>One Watson, who assumed for the occasion the name of T. Johnson, printed
a piratical edition of the new octavos. Dodsley filed a bill against him
in Chancery on November 25<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span> for the invasion of the copyright of Pope's
edition in folio. On October 31, Dodsley had entered at Stationers'
Hall, "The Works of Alexander Pope, Esq., Vol. V. and Vol. VI. The
second edition corrected. 8vo." He had omitted to enter the previous
edition of the octavos, and in a letter which Watson wrote on November
30 he objected that the folio was not the book he had pirated, and that
the octavo volumes were only entered at Stationers' Hall on October 31,
which he says "was at least a full month after the publication of the
edition complained of, and Pope's own first edition entirely sold before
the octavo was entered." His meaning was that since the first edition of
the octavo had not been entered, the entry of the second edition, which
was subsequent to the piracy, came too late to secure the copyright. The
greater part, however, of Watson's volumes were identical with the text
of the folio which had been entered on May 18, and Watson did not
persevere in his defence. He consented to deliver up the 1646 copies in
his possession on the receipt of 25<i>l.</i>, and to give Pope a bond in
which he undertook to pay a penalty of 100<i>l.</i> if he ever again invaded
his rights by printing any of his works.<a name="FNanchor_114_129" id="FNanchor_114_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_129" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Pope's prohibition of Watson's work, coupled with his own publication of
the octavos, is fresh evidence of the insincerity of his professed
dissatisfaction with the P. T. selection. His apology for replacing in
the octavos the letters he had rejected was that they were in process of
being reinstated in a piratical edition of the quarto.<a name="FNanchor_115_130" id="FNanchor_115_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_130" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Pope had the
power, which he used, to stop piratical publications, and at the same
time he absurdly made the piracy the plea for publishing himself the
condemned letters he had cast aside. His mode of relieving his disgust
at their appearance, and of giving effect to his eager desire for their
suppression was to lay hold of a hollow excuse for reprinting them.</p>

<p>While Pope proceeded against Watson he submitted to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span> piracies of
Curll. His conduct once more betrayed that he was the author of the P.
T. plot. Curll had all along persisted in printing the P. T. letters. He
immediately seized the new letters in the quarto, and inserted them in
his fifth volume of "Mr. Pope's Literary Correspondence." He was not
content with usurping Pope's property. He insulted, defied, and accused
him. Pope had the strongest motive in self-vindication to grapple with
the charges of Curll, and he shrunk from the contest. He resented the
infringement of his copyright by an indifferent person, and he could not
willingly have endured to be despoiled by his mocking antagonist, and
sit down quietly under the contumely and wrong. The bill filed against
Watson discovers the cause of his forbearance. There we find that Pope
in applying for an injunction was obliged to state that his quarto
edition was the first publication of his letters "with his consent,
direction, or approbation,"<a name="FNanchor_116_131" id="FNanchor_116_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_131" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and if he had filed a similar bill
against Curll, the bookseller would have proved that he had purchased
the P. T. edition, and that Pope had printed and sold it. Curll
announced in September, 1735, that he had filed a bill against Smythe to
compel the fulfilment of his contract, and he made Gilliver a party to
the suit in consequence of his confession that Pope had purchased of him
the old sheets of the Wycherley, and directed the rest of the P. T.
collection to be printed to match them.<a name="FNanchor_117_132" id="FNanchor_117_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_132" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Smythe was a shadow who
could not be reached. The facts remained, and Pope could not attempt to
convict Curll of piracy without being himself convicted of having sold
him the work. He had been worsted on this very point when he fought with
his best weapon, the pen, and he did not dare to renew the conflict in a
court of law where allegations could neither be passed over in silence,
nor be met by evasions and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span> quibbles. Any doubt that the motive for his
toleration was fear was done away by his filing a bill against Curll the
instant he pirated the Swift Correspondence which was entirely distinct
from the P. T. transaction.</p>

<p>Pope had shown earlier that he was afraid to join issue with Curll
before a legal tribunal. Curll inserted an advertisement in "Fog's
Journal" of July 26, 1735, in which he accused Pope of having printed
the P. T. collection, and of telling falsehoods in self-defence. The
proprietor of "Fog's Journal" was induced by a threat of prosecution to
apologise for the insertion of the advertisement, and Curll immediately
reprinted it in the second volume of Mr. Pope's Literary Correspondence,
accompanied by a scornful account of Pope's interference. Pope did not
venture to accept the taunting challenge. His vapouring ceased when he
was dared to fight. He menaced the publisher of a newspaper, who would
not brave a trial in a cause which was not his own, and tamely retreated
before the real offender in person.</p>

<p>The octavo edition of 1737 enables us to put the veracity of Pope in
repudiating the P. T. collection to yet another proof. In May and July,
1735, he published advertisements protesting that several letters
ascribed to him in the P. T. volume were not his.<a name="FNanchor_118_133" id="FNanchor_118_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_133" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> He prefixed to
the octavo of 1737 a catalogue of surreptitious editions, in which he
repeated that the P. T. publication "contained several letters not
genuine."<a name="FNanchor_119_134" id="FNanchor_119_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_134" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> He had hitherto been loud in exclaiming against the P. T.
forgeries without being imprudent enough to name them. His caution
relaxed as time wore on, and he had the courage to state on the
title-page of the first octavo edition of 1737 that he had "added to the
letters of the author's own edition all that are genuine from the former
impressions." The spurious letters in the P. T. collection were thus
declared to be the letters which were excluded from the octavo edition
of 1737. They were seven in number. Three were letters, or extracts of
letters, from Wycherley, two belonged to the section headed "Letters to
Several Ladies," and two were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span> letters to Gay. Unless they were really
forgeries, Pope told and retold emphatic lies to discredit the P. T.
collection, and establish his innocence, and the deceit would leave no
doubt of his criminality.</p>

<p>Four letters out of the seven we know to have been genuine. The three
letters of Wycherley were on the sheets transferred from the edition of
his posthumous works which was published by Pope, and copies of two of
them are among the Oxford papers. One of the suppressed letters to
ladies exists in duplicate, and was sent by Pope to Miss Blount, and to
Miss Marriot, the friend and neighbour of his coadjutor Broome. The
letters are both originals in the handwriting of Pope. There are no
means of verifying the remaining three letters, nor is it necessary to
test them, when more than half the pretended forgeries are found to be
authentic. Once again we have absolute evidence that his accusation of
forgery was an acted clamour to screen himself. He finally adopted all
the letters but seven, and his assertion that these seven were
fabrications was a falsehood.</p>

<p>Besides the necessity Pope was under of rejecting some of the P. T.
letters to bear out his mendacious charge of forgery, he had particular
reasons for disclaiming three at least of the four letters which
proceeded from his own pen. The letter he addressed to Miss Blount and
Miss Marriot was a disquisition on a human monstrosity exhibiting in
London. He had said in his Essay on Criticism that "vile obscenity
should find no pardon." He was among the offenders he pronounced
unpardonable, and often revelled in dull and studied indecorums which he
mistook for wit. The laboured letter he esteemed so highly that he sent
it to two of his female correspondents was more than ordinarily gross
and stupid. The fancied humour appeared to the public revolting
coarseness, and he cast out the letter because it excited disgust and
contempt.</p>

<p>The next letter Pope rejected consisted of a satirical and false
description of Blenheim. He represented a fraction of the house to be
the whole, and founded upon his mis-statement the reflection, "I think
the architect built it entirely in complaisance to the taste of its
owners; for it is the most inhospitable thing imaginable, and the most
selfish." A second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[Pg lxxvii]</a></span> sarcasm on the Duchess in the P. T. volume was
obliterated in the octavo of 1737. "Cleland," Pope writes to Gay, "is at
Tunbridge. He plays now with the old Duchess of M&mdash;&mdash;, nay, dines with
her after she has won all his money." In the octavo of 1737 he erased
the name, and left the passage to be applied to any old duchess who was
then alive. He had obviously some inducement to renounce his abuse of
the Duchess of Marlborough, and the probable cause was that a friendly
intercourse had grown up in the interval. He speaks of her to Swift in
1739 as paying "great court to him."<a name="FNanchor_120_135" id="FNanchor_120_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_135" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>His desire to disavow an ebullition of enmity which had been succeeded
by renewed cordiality, was his apparent motive for cancelling a letter
addressed to Gay. Fielding relates that no person during "the reign of
King Alexander" would read a work which had not his license, and "this
license he granted to only four authors&mdash;Swift, Young, Arbuthnot, and
Gay&mdash;his principal courtiers and favourites."<a name="FNanchor_121_136" id="FNanchor_121_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_136" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> It chanced that one
of the courtiers was in disgrace when the P. T. volume appeared, and
Pope introduced a sneer at his egotism and pomposity. "In a word," he
says to Gay, "Y&mdash;&mdash;g himself has not acquired more tragic majesty in his
aspect by reading his own verses than I by Homer's." The offence of
Young was a species of remonstrance he sent to the monarch under the
guise of advice. Pope completed his Essay on Man in 1734, and Young
urged him in "a pressing letter to write something on the side of
revelation in order to take off the impression of those doctrines which
the Essay seemed to convey." Harte, a minor courtier of king Alexander,
told Warton that the sensitive monarch "took the letter amiss."<a name="FNanchor_122_137" id="FNanchor_122_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_137" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> He
was annoyed at the censure implied in the exhortation, and retaliated by
ridiculing the self-importance of his monitor. When Pope was taxed with
personalities he could not defend, he never scrupled, where it was
possible, to deny that he alluded to the person who remonstrated. When
evasion was impracticable, and the work had not been avowed, the easiest
course was to repudiate the authorship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>These were the circumstances which chiefly governed Pope's selection of
the P. T. forgeries. Had there been a single fabricated letter he would
have hastened to name it, just as he specified in his preface to the
quarto some fictitious letters which were not in the P. T. publication.
The P. T. letters being authentic, he was afraid to disclaim in print
particular letters which surviving persons might know to be his, and he
could not venture to advance beyond the indirect statement that the
octavo of 1737 "contained all the letters that were genuine from former
impressions." Trusting that no one who could convict him would be at the
trouble to collate the editions, he thought himself safe from exposure,
and he could privately appeal, with little risk of detection, to the
disclaimer on his title-page when he had merely to disown a letter in
his individual intercourse with the Duchess of Marlborough or Young. He
did not care to increase the hazard of discovery by repeating his
title-page. He dropped it in the second edition of the octavo, and the
assertion that he had printed "all the letters that are genuine from the
former impressions" dwindled down to the assurance that "there is not
one but is genuine."<a name="FNanchor_123_138" id="FNanchor_123_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_138" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The controversies on Pope's character have naturally drawn forth
uncompromising language both from defenders and accusers. Those who
believed him incapable of the acts imputed to him could but conclude
that he was bitterly calumniated. Those who believed that the charges
were true could but brand him with reprobation. The offences were not of
a nature to be softened by apologies. De Quincey was in a lenient mood
when he wrote his sketch of Pope's Life, and his more favourable
impressions necessarily carried with them the conviction that the
"disgraceful imputation" against Pope of having made Curll his tool and
victim was "most assuredly unfounded."<a name="FNanchor_124_139" id="FNanchor_124_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_139" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Speaking, on another
occasion, of Pope's attack on Hill and the Duke of Chandos, he says,
"Evil is the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg lxxix]</a></span> for a conscientious man when his sole resource for
self-defence lies in a falsehood."<a name="FNanchor_125_140" id="FNanchor_125_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_140" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> De Quincey was ignorant of the
history of the letters, and he would have altered his opinion if he had
known that Pope in self-defence had been prodigal of the falsehoods
which are the last refuge of guilt.</p>

<p>There still remains the small episode of the six letters unconnected
with the P. T. volume, which were declared by Pope to be spurious in his
preface to the quarto. Four of them purported to be from Pope to Miss
Blount, and two to be letters of Atterbury to Pope. Those to Miss Blount
were forwarded to Curll by a correspondent who signed himself S. E. The
bookseller published them in the third volume of "Mr. Pope's Literary
Correspondence," and announced that he had discovered them to be
translations from Voiture. S. E. only professed to send copies, which
are now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Mr. Carruthers states
correctly that the size and quality of the paper is precisely the same
as in the genuine letters of the poet, and that the handwriting appears
to be his "a little disguised." The letters bear on their face the marks
of their origin, and Pope acted according to usage in endeavouring to
delude Curll that he might afterwards build a charge upon his own
deceptions. There is, however, a second claimant for the honour of
having devised the cheat. In an edition of Pope's works, which belonged
to Douce the antiquary, some one has copied an extract from a letter of
Mr. J. Plumptre, dated May 1, 1744, in which he informs his wife that
their son Charles, who was afterwards Rector of St. Mary Woolnoth,
London, and Archdeacon of Ely, was the author of the trick.<a name="FNanchor_126_141" id="FNanchor_126_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_141" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The
incident was nine years old when Mr. Plumptre proudly acquainted Mrs.
Plumptre with the secret. He mentioned that the letters were sent to
Curll by the penny post, and the original cover in the Bodleian Library
shows that they were not sent by post at all. He said that his son
translated them, and Pope had proclaimed that they were borrowed from a
published translation. The account is false, and the pretended extract
from the letter may be itself apocryphal, for its authenticity is
guaranteed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[Pg lxxx]</a></span> no external testimony. The similarity of paper and
handwriting, coupled with the pressing necessity Pope was under to
supply himself with examples of fabrication, strongly indicate that the
person who profited by the imposition contrived it.</p>

<p>Pope affirmed in his preface that the two letters ascribed to Atterbury
had never been seen by the bishop or himself, and to show the absurdity
of the fraud he adds that "they were advertised even after that period
when it was made felony to correspond with him." At length, in 1739, one
of the letters was adopted in a reprint of Cooper's octavos, and
undoubtedly by the order of the poet himself, since it was included in
the collection he delivered to Warburton. "We have ventured," says a
note in the Cooper edition, "to insert this letter, which was plainly
intended for Mr. Pope, though we are informed that on second thoughts it
was not judged proper to send it him. A copy was preserved and published
soon after in the English additions to Bayle's Dictionary, under the
article of Atterbury." Pope's assertion, in the preface to the quarto,
that the letter was fabricated, was either a reckless charge or a
falsehood, and there are strong grounds for believing that he was all
along aware that the letter was genuine. In the catalogue of
surreptitious editions we are told of Curll's second volume that it has
no letters to Mr. Pope, "but one said to be Bishop Atterbury's, and
another in that bishop's name, certainly not his." The distinction drawn
between the two amounts to an admission that the former might be
authentic; and this is confirmed in the conclusion of the catalogue,
where a reprint of the P.T. collection is described as containing the
"forged letter," not letters, "from the Bishop of Rochester," though
this very reprint contained them both. They were introduced into all the
reprints themselves in a manner which showed that they were not
considered of equal authority. In Curll's work, they are represented to
be alike by Atterbury, and to be addressed alike to Pope. In the
reprints of the P. T. collection, the letter which Pope ultimately
accepted is alone given as written by Atterbury, or addressed to the
poet. Its fellow has asterisks to represent the person to whom it was
sent, and neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</a></span> asterisks nor name to represent the sender. Pope's
ally, Cooper, is supposed to have been concerned in the volume to which
the Atterbury epistles were first transferred from the publication of
Curll, and it is obvious that no bookseller would have originated the
alteration, and that no other person would have prompted it who had not
a peculiar interest in the correspondence of the poet, and who was not
aware that these stray productions would be at once appended to a
current P. T. impression. The distinction between the letters was made
in the reprints of the P. T. collection before Pope published the
preface to the quarto, in which he affirmed that both were
counterfeited. He made the distinction in the catalogue almost
immediately after the quarto appeared. He did not the less preserve the
passage in his preface unchanged in every edition of his correspondence,
and never uttered a single word of recantation. He allowed the charge of
forgery to be circulated till it had served his purpose; and then,
without an allusion to his former language, imported the letter into his
works with the complacent announcement "that it was plainly intended for
Mr. Pope."</p>

<p>The reason assigned by Pope why a letter must be forged which he
afterwards admitted to be genuine, was one of his usual deceptions. By
the Bill of pains and penalties against Atterbury it was declared to be
felony to correspond with him in his exile after June 25, 1723. Pope
disregarded the enactment with little risk of discovery, and perhaps
without much danger of punishment if his harmless intercourse was
detected. He condoled with the bishop on the death of his daughter, Mrs.
Morice; and the bishop thus commenced his reply, which is dated
Montpelier, November 20, 1729: "Yes, dear sir, I have had all you
designed for me, and have read all, as I read whatever you write, with
esteem and pleasure. But your last letter, full of friendship and
goodness, gave me such impressions of concern and tenderness, as neither
I can express, nor you, perhaps, with all the force of your imagination,
fully conceive." This again must have drawn forth a response from the
poet, for Atterbury says in an answer without date, "I venture to thank
you for your kind and friendly letter, because I think myself very sure
of a safe conveyance, and I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg lxxxii]</a></span> uneasy till I have told you what
impressions it made upon me. I will do it with the same simplicity with
which I wrote to you from Montpelier upon a very melancholy occasion."
These extracts testify that the letter which Curll published of November
23, 1731, was not a solitary instance, and that other letters had passed
between the poet and Atterbury "even after that period when it was made
felony to correspond with him." The proof which Pope urged with
triumphant scorn to demonstrate that the letter of November 23 must be
counterfeited was therefore an absolute fraud. His disingenuousness did
not end here. He printed Atterbury's letter of November 20, 1729, at the
same time that he reproduced the letter published by Curll, and said in
a note,&mdash;"This also seems genuine, though whether written to Mr. P. or
some learned friend in France, is uncertain; but we doubt not it will be
acceptable to the reader." To support the alleged uncertainty he omitted
the passages which showed that it was addressed to a sickly poet in
England. The complete letter was inserted by Mr. Nichols in the
"Epistolary Correspondence of Atterbury," and his version is confirmed
by a copy among the Oxford papers at Longleat. The bishop died in
February, 1732; and if in 1739 Pope thought it unsafe to admit that he
had held communication with him in his banishment upon literary and
domestic topics, he might have left the letter to be published by
Warburton, and not have violated truth for the sake of hurrying it
before the world.</p>

<p>Such was the series of stratagems which ushered in and accompanied the
collection of 1735, from its first appearance in the volume of P. T. to
its final shape in the volumes of Cooper. Pope's skill in deception was
not equal to his passion for it. Audacity was the chief characteristic
of his contrivances, and equivocation and lying his weapons of defence.
When a trick or a subterfuge was detected, and could no longer be
denied, he yet remained unabashed, and dropping all allusion to the
points which had been proved against him, he continued to rely upon the
falsehoods or fallacies which had been less completely exposed. His
pertinacity in reiterating that he was sinned against when he was
sinning, derived support from his literary fame, which gave currency to
his representations, and in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">[Pg lxxxiii]</a></span> degree gained credit to them. But his
duplicity and his artifices were known to many, and it would be
difficult to say whether his effrontery or his hypocrisy was most
conspicuous when he affixed to the preface to the quarto of 1737 the
punning motto, <i>Vellem nescire literas</i>, bewailed in the preface itself
the necessity for the publication, hoped that no honest man might be
reduced to a similar dilemma, talked with injured indignation of thefts,
forgeries, and piracies, and exhorted the legislature to provide a
remedy against the evil. His tone was not moderated by the suspicions he
had roused, and the humiliations he had undergone. They had just as
little effect in abating his love of treachery, or blunting his appetite
for epistolary fame, and he was no sooner clear of one plot than he
engaged in another of the same description, and for the same ends.</p>

<p>His correspondence with Swift appeared in 1741. The English edition was
a sequel to the quarto of 1737, and formed part of what was called on
the title-page, "The Works of Mr. Alexander Pope, in Prose, Vol. II." In
a prefatory notice to the reader, the letters are stated to have been
"copied from an impression sent from Dublin, and said to have been
printed by the Dean's direction," an impression, it is added, "which was
begun without our author's knowledge, and continued without his
consent." Pope held the same language in private to Allen and Warburton,
and professed to be extremely annoyed at the step. His account has been
almost uniformly accepted as true till the critic in the Athen&aelig;um showed
that the publication of the correspondence with Swift was no exception
to the previous proceedings of the poet, and that, as in the case of the
Wycherley letters of 1729, and the miscellaneous collection of 1735, he
himself had sent the manuscripts to the press, and charged the act upon
others.</p>

<p>On November 28, 1729, Pope protested to Swift that it was many years
since he endeavoured to play the wit in his familiar correspondence. He
assured the Dean that as he had a greater love and esteem for him than
for others, so he wrote to him with even more than ordinary negligence.
"I smile to think," he continues, "how Curll would be bit were our
epistles to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[Pg lxxxiv]</a></span> fall into his hands, and how gloriously they would fall
short of every ingenious reader's expectations." Warburton tells us that
Pope valued himself upon this abstinence from all effort to be
brilliant;<a name="FNanchor_127_142" id="FNanchor_127_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_142" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> but his pretence of sinking the author in the friend
gained no credit from Swift, who took care to show his incredulity. "I
find," he replied on February 26, 1730, "you have been a writer of
letters almost from your infancy; and, by your own confession, had
schemes even then of epistolary fame. Montaigne says that if he could
have excelled in any kind of writing it would have been in letters; but
I doubt they would not have been natural, for it is plain that all
Pliny's letters were written with a view of publishing, and I accuse
Voiture of the same crime, although he be an author I am fond of. They
cease to be letters when they become a <i>jeu d'esprit</i>." Pope seems to
have suspected that this half-direct, half-oblique criticism was
suggested by his recent collection and arrangement of his
correspondence, and he denied, in his answer of April 9, that he was
open to the censure. "I am pleased," he observed, "to see your
partiality, and it is for that reason I have kept some of your letters,
and some of those of my other friends. These if I put together in a
volume for my own secret satisfaction in reviewing a life passed in
innocent amusements and studies, not without the good will of worthy and
ingenious men, do not therefore say I aim at epistolary fame. I never
had any fame less in my head; but the fame I most covet, indeed, is that
which must be derived to me from my friendships." The poet as usual
adapted his assertions to the exigencies of the moment; for it was not
for "his own secret satisfaction in reviewing a life passed in innocent
amusements and studies," that he had deposited a duplicate of the volume
with Lord Oxford, or kept it in readiness "against the revival of
slanders, and the publication of surreptitious letters." This
suppression of facts and motives could have had no effect in deluding
Swift. Once on September 3, 1735, when his faculties were waning, and
his powers rose and fell with his malady, he echoed back Pope's former
language. "Neither," he said, "did our letters contain any turns of wit,
or fancy, or politics, or satire, but mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[Pg lxxxv]</a></span> innocent friendship. I
believe we neither of us ever leaned our head upon our hand to study
what we should write next." But by the 21st of October he had already
returned to his old conviction, and after mentioning the publication of
the poet's correspondence by Curll, he added, "I believe my letters have
escaped being published because I writ nothing but nature and
friendship, and particular incidents which could make no figure in
writing,"&mdash;a plain intimation that the opposite qualities had, in his
opinion, caused the letters of Pope to be communicated to the world.</p>

<p>The poet made the volume of 1735 the plea for pressing Swift to return
him his letters. He had ceased to smile at the thought how Curll would
be bit by getting hold of them, and earnestly demanded that the Dean
should "secure him against that rascal printer."<a name="FNanchor_128_143" id="FNanchor_128_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_143" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> If it is admitted
that Pope was the publisher of the P. T. collection, his accusations
against the rascal printer were groundless, and his fears were feigned.
He was endeavouring, under cover of a false pretence, to obtain
possession of his letters to Swift, and it was easy to foresee that when
he had succeeded in his object the secret store would soon be laid open
to the public. He had previously forced his other friends to surrender
his correspondence by the clamorous apprehensions he expressed of Curll.
The letters which were safe in their guardianship had not been long
committed to his keeping when they came forth from the shop of this very
individual, and Pope was now urging the fact as a reason why fresh
letters should be transferred from a custody which had been effectual to
a custody which had proved to be insecure. Swift, perhaps, by this time,
had begun to penetrate the designs of his friend, and he declined to
comply with his request. "You need not fear any consequence," he wrote
September 3, 1735, "in the commerce that hath so long passed between us,
although I never destroyed one of your letters. But my executors are men
of honour and virtue, who have strict orders in my will to burn every
letter left behind me. Yet I am loth that any letters from you and a
very few friends should die before me." No answer could have been less
pleasing to Pope than to be told that his letters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[Pg lxxxvi]</a></span> were doomed to
destruction. His eagerness to rescue them must have been increased by
the announcement, and he offered, if Swift would let him have them at
once, to send him copies. The poet's excuse for a proposal which
defeated his professed purpose, was "merely that the originals might not
fall into the hands of Curll, and thereby a hundred particulars be at
his mercy."<a name="FNanchor_129_144" id="FNanchor_129_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_144" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The particulars would have been as much at Curll's
mercy in the copies as in the originals they replaced, unless Pope
intended to disavow the transcripts he had himself furnished, which
shows how much value is to be attached to his assertion that parts of
the collection of 1735 were forged. His remonstrances induced Swift to
promise that the letters should not be committed to the flames; but he
persevered in refusing to surrender them while he lived. "As to what you
say of your letters," he wrote April 22, 1736, "my resolution is to
direct my executors to send you all your letters well sealed and
pacquetted, and leave them entirely to your disposal. These things are
all tied up, endorsed and locked in a cabinet, and I have not one
servant who can properly be said to write or read. No mortal shall copy
them, but you shall surely have them when I am no more." Since Swift
persisted in believing that he could protect private papers from Curll
quite as efficiently as the poet, who had signally failed in the
attempt, Pope reversed his petition, and disclosing his real intention,
begged that he might have them to print. "I told him," he says, in his
account to Lord Orrery, "as soon as I found myself obliged to publish an
edition of my letters to my great sorrow, that I wished to make use of
some of these, nor did I think any part of my correspondence would do me
a greater honour, and be really a greater pleasure to me, than what
might preserve the memory how well we loved one another. I find the Dean
was not quite of the same opinion, or he would not, I think, have denied
this." When Pope affected in 1729 to depreciate his correspondence with
Swift, that he might mask his design in gathering together his other
letters, he had even smiled to reflect "how gloriously our epistles
would fall short of every ingenious reader's expectations." He now
maintained that "our epistles" would confer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[Pg lxxxvii]</a></span> upon him a vast deal of
honour, which he could not suppose would be obtained by balking
expectation. But though none of these inconsistencies are immaterial,
the most important circumstance, and one which bears upon the whole of
the subsequent evidence, is that Pope was pining for the publication of
the letters, and Swift would not consent to it.</p>

<p>An event happened opportunely to assist the solicitations of the poet.
Towards the close of 1736 Curll printed a couple of letters to Swift, of
which the first was written by Pope, and the second by Bolingbroke. The
bookseller announced that they were transmitted to him from Ireland,
together with several other valuable originals, and Pope on the 30th of
December employed this practical proof to convince the Dean that the
correspondence was not safe in his custody. The two letters, as they
were called, were in fact a joint epistle; for not only does the portion
of Bolingbroke purport to be a continuation of the portion of the poet,
but Swift, who had been absent, says in the reply, which on his return
home he addressed to Pope, "I found a letter from you with an <i>appendix</i>
longer than yours from Bolingbroke." The letter and its appendix were
printed by Curll at the period when Pope had exhausted his arguments to
induce Swift to resign the correspondence, and the occurrence was so
well timed for the purposes of the poet, and the device so much in
accordance with his practices, that it is impossible not to suspect that
he contrived the injury as a means of extorting the redress. The
original of his share of the epistle still exists,<a name="FNanchor_130_145" id="FNanchor_130_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_145" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and shows that
the published version has been edited in his usual fashion. The
variations, in the aggregate, could not have arisen from carelessness,
and they are not of a kind which an independent person could have had
any motive to introduce from design. The appendix of Bolingbroke had
been in the power of Pope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[Pg lxxxviii]</a></span> who might have transcribed it, together with
his own contribution, before it was sent; but he declared that he never
possessed a copy of either,<a name="FNanchor_131_146" id="FNanchor_131_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_146" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and small as is the credit due to his
protestations, he may have spoken the truth in this particular, and been
guilty not the less. The Dean was accustomed to lend his acquaintances a
volume in which he had stitched specimens of the letters of his eminent
friends.<a name="FNanchor_132_147" id="FNanchor_132_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_147" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The joint letter of August, 1723, was preserved,<a name="FNanchor_133_148" id="FNanchor_133_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_148" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> when
the letters of Pope to Swift for a considerable period before and after
were lost or destroyed, and it is likely that it escaped the common fate
by its insertion in the volume of selections. There it was easily
accessible, and as Worsdale, the reputed mock-clergyman, who had
personated Smythe, was sometimes resident in Dublin, his old employer
had a trusty, or at any rate a trusted agent, ready to his hand. Curll
did not print any more of his boasted originals, and he probably only
spoke on the faith of promises which had been made him with a view to
compel compliance from the Dean, by persuading him that traitors had
admission to his cabinet.</p>

<p>The announcement of the publication by Curll of the joint letter of
August 23 had not the desired effect upon Swift. In his reply he took no
notice of the circumstance, and Pope, finding that nothing he could urge
would shake his resolution, addressed, in the beginning of March, 1737,
a statement of the case to Lord Orrery, who was then in Ireland, and
engaged him to second his entreaties. Lord Orrery obtained a promise
from Swift that the correspondence should be returned, and offered to be
the bearer of it. The Dean accordingly acquaints Pope, July 23, 1737,
that "when his lordship goes over, which will be, as he hopes, in about
ten days, he will take with him all the letters I preserved of yours."
"I cannot," said Swift, in making the communication, "trust my memory
half an hour," and this passage was a proof that he did not exaggerate
his infirmity. Lord Orrery had set sail in the middle of June, and under
the same date<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[Pg lxxxix]</a></span> that Swift wrote from Ireland that his lordship would go
over in about ten days, his lordship wrote to Swift from England, "Your
commands are obeyed long ago. Dr. King has his cargo, Mrs. Barber her
Conversation, and Mr. Pope his letters." Mrs. Barber's Conversation was
the manuscript of the "Polite Conversation" of Swift, which she had
asked permission to print for her own advantage, and the cargo for Dr.
King was the manuscript of the "History of the Four Last Years of Queen
Anne," which the Dean was anxious to print for his own credit. But much
as it was in his thoughts at this time, he only remembered his settled
intention to send the papers&mdash;whether history, conversation, or
letters&mdash;by Lord Orrery, and the act by which the intention was
fulfilled had already faded from his mind. The understanding of Swift
was rapidly yielding to his mournful malady, and the first faculty to
suffer was his memory.</p>

<p>The letters of Pope were therefore in his own keeping, and out of the
power of Swift, before July 23, 1737. The Dean, however, informed him
that "by reading the dates he found a chasm of six years," and that he
had searched for the missing correspondence in vain. Pope did not
abandon the hope of recovering it, and Swift, apparently in reply to his
applications, wrote on August 8, 1738, to acquaint him that every letter
received from him for twenty years and upwards had been sealed up in
bundles, and consigned to the custody of Mrs. Whiteway, whom he
describes as "a very worthy, rational, and judicious cousin of mine."
Mrs. Whiteway, who had none of the papers, had a short time before kept
Swift from sending a similar fictitious account, but the idea had taken
deep root in his mind, and rightly conjecturing that he would reiterate
it, she engaged Lord Orrery to inform Pope that she had neither got any
of the correspondence herself, nor had the slightest knowledge where it
was.<a name="FNanchor_134_149" id="FNanchor_134_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_149" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> On the present, as on the former occasion, Swift showed her
what he had written, and on the 24th of August he subjoined a postscript
in which, after saying that he would correct, if it were possible, the
blunders committed in his letter, he simply added that his cousin had
assured him that "a great collection of your/my letters to me/you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">[Pg xc]</a></span>
put up and scaled, and in some very safe hand." The counter-assurance of
Mrs. Whiteway to Lord Orrery that she had no knowledge of the
collection, shows that the corrected version was as fanciful as the
original statement. Swift's language in 1738 would imply that the chasm
in the correspondence no longer existed, and that no part of the series
had yet been transmitted to England; but it was the language of a man
labouring under the misapprehension and obliviousness produced by
disease, and could have little weight in opposition to the testimony
that Pope had received back a packet of his letters in the previous
year. Any doubt which could have existed on the point is done away by
the admission of Pope himself. Mrs. Whiteway had refused in 1740 to send
back some of his letters by the mother of the Mr. Nugent, who afterwards
became Lord Clare, because the poet had authorised her to entrust them
to a Mr. M'Aulay. "I believe," Pope wrote to Mr. Nugent, "they had
entertained a jealousy of you, as the same persons did before of my Lord
Orrery. They then prevented the Dean from complying to any purpose with
my request. They then sent a few just to save appearances, and possibly
to serve as a sort of plea to excuse them of being taxed with this
proceeding, which is now thrown upon the Dean himself."<a name="FNanchor_135_150" id="FNanchor_135_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_150" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The
"proceeding" was the committing the correspondence to the press, and
Pope, on his own part, to avoid being taxed with it, was privately
putting forth the plea that the bulk of his letters had not been
returned to him. The confession that he had received a few is a complete
answer to the delusion of Swift, and they must have been more than a
very few, or they would not have been sufficient "to save appearances."
Setting aside the representations of the poet, upon which no dependence
can be placed, except when he bears witness against himself, there is
nothing to oppose, and much to confirm the idea that they were the
identical "few" which were published in the quarto of 1741.</p>

<p>When Swift first collected the letters in May, 1737, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[Pg xci]</a></span> mentioned that
they were not much above sixty, and in July, when they had been sent
away, and he described his past act in the language of intention, he
said they were not above twenty-five. His account in July, when the
correspondence was no longer under his eye, and when his failing memory
made him forget the departure of Lord Orrery, is far less reliable than
his account in May when he was fresh from the task of sorting the
letters. A smaller number than he specified appeared in the quarto
which, exclusive of the answers of the Dean, contains only forty. This
upon an average does not amount to two a year, and the poet, when he had
an end to serve, would not have scrupled to call even sixty "few" in
comparison with the many that had been written. Swift imagined that the
missing letters might have been lost on some of those occasions when he
had been compelled to entrust his papers to friends, and Pope may
honestly have believed that they were detained by designing persons; but
they were never published, while those which were printed have a chasm
of seven years, from June, 1716, to August, 1723, or only one year more
than the Dean detected in the series he got ready to despatch to
Twickenham. The new correspondence, like Pope's previous volumes, was
merely a selection, and there is but a single letter of the poet to
Swift in 1714, none whatever in 1715, and again but a single letter in
1716. The suppression of the letters in 1717, as in 1715, or even a slip
of memory or a slip of the pen with the Dean, both of which had become a
frequent occurrence, will account for the slight discrepancy between the
chasm in the printed volume, and the chasm which Swift announced. The
letter of August, 1723, is the joint letter of Pope and Bolingbroke,
which was sent corrected to Curll, and this is followed by a second gap
from August, 1723, to September 14, 1725. The extensive hiatus in the
correspondence of which Pope was forewarned by Swift, must in all reason
be supposed to be the chief deficiency of which Pope complained, though
in language coloured to suit his purpose; and when a similar blank
exists in the quarto, there is a strong presumption that the letters
which he acknowledged had been sent to save appearances, were the same
letters of which the book was composed. A kindred circumstance supports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">[Pg xcii]</a></span>
the conclusion. The last letter of Pope in the quarto is dated March 23,
1737, which falls in with the fact that the collection was gathered
together in May and transmitted to him in June; but if the volume of
1741 had proceeded from Swift, it would be a curious coincidence, that
not a single line written by the poet since the time when his
correspondence was returned to him should have found its way into the
work.</p>

<p>It is against the innocence of Pope that in his public statements he
kept out of sight the fact that he had received back a certain portion
of the correspondence, and designedly conveyed the impression that the
whole of it remained with Swift. In the advertisement to the quarto it
is said that Pope could not be prevailed upon to revise the volume
printed in Dublin; but that he had furnished the London booksellers with
a few more of the letters of the Dean a little to clear up the history
of their publication. The reader is informed that he will see this
history in one view if he observes the passages marked by inverted
commas. The story they reveal is that Swift ultimately promised to send
the correspondence, that he collected it for the purpose, and ended by
sending none of it. The Dean's communication of August 8 is produced as
exhibiting the final result, and Pope marked with inverted commas the
declaration, "I can faithfully assure you that every letter you have
favoured me with, these twenty years and more, are sealed up in bundles
and delivered to Mrs. Whiteway." The sense in which the poet wished the
passage to be understood is defined in the table of contents. "The
entire collection of his and Mr. Pope's letters for twenty years and
upwards found, and in the hands of a lady, a worthy and judicious
relation of the Dean's.&mdash;This a mistake, not in hers, but in some other
safe hands." A note was added by Pope to the letter for the purpose of
strengthening the case against Swift; but not one syllable did he let
drop to indicate that the Dean was deceived in supposing that the series
remained unbroken, and that no part of it had been sent back. The
testimony of another witness, which had the appearance of corroborating
the error, was produced by the poet. The assertion in the postscript
that Mrs. Whiteway vouched for "a great collection being in some very
safe hand," seems to have beguiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[Pg xciii]</a></span> him into the belief that the missing
letters had turned up, and Lord Orrery having lately come from Ireland
he applied to him on the subject. Lord Orrery answered, that Mrs.
Whiteway knew nothing of the letters, that he was satisfied they were
neither lost nor burnt, and that his attempts to discover where they
were deposited had been fruitless. To us, who are aware that Lord Orrery
had been the bearer of an instalment of the correspondence, it is plain
that he is referring to that portion of it which could not be found when
he carried over the remainder. To those who had only before them the
version contained in the quarto, and who merely read of an intention to
send letters by him in July, 1737, which had not been forwarded in
August, 1738, his general expressions in answer to Pope would appear to
apply to the whole of the correspondence, and seem a confirmation of the
delusion of Swift. The poet made himself responsible for the
misconceptions of the Dean by marking them with inverted commas, by
supporting them with specious subsidiary evidence, and attesting that
they embodied the history of the publication; and since they leave an
impression which he knew to be false upon the precise particular which
implicates himself, his disingenuous sanction of the error must be
considered to be the act of conscious guilt.</p>

<p>"I should think with you, madam," Lord Orrery wrote to Mrs. Whiteway,
"that some of Mr. Pope's servants had stolen the letters, did not many
appear from various people to the Dean, of which Mr. Pope cannot be
supposed either to have seen the copies or originals." With our present
information, the letters in the collection which are not from the pen of
Pope tell the other way, and contribute in a powerful degree to fix the
publication on him. The replies of Swift, together with much of Swift's
correspondence with Gay, are included in the volume, and it will be
found upon examination that all these materials were likely to have been
furnished by the poet, and that part of them could have been furnished
by nobody else. He has twice touched upon the subject in the annotations
to the quarto. The first note is attached to the heading, "Letters of
Dr. Swift to Mr. Gray," and states that they were "found among Mr. Gay's
papers, and returned to Dr. Swift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[Pg xciv]</a></span> by the Duke of Queensberry and Mr.
Pope." The second note is appended to that portion of the postscript of
August 24, 1738, in which the Dean mentions "a great collection of
your/my letters to me/you." "It is written," subjoins the poet, "just
thus in the original. The book that is now printed seems to be part of
the collection here spoken of, as it contains not only the letters of
Mr. Pope, but of Dr. Swift, both to him and Mr. Gay, which were returned
him after Mr. Gay's death, though any mention made by Mr. P. of the
return or exchange of letters has been industriously suppressed in the
publication, and only appears by some of the answers."</p>

<p>The case of Gay is first to be considered. There is not an allusion in
any of the "answers," either to the exchange of the letters which passed
between Gay and Swift, or the return of the letters which Swift
addressed to Gay. An exchange, at all events, had not taken place. The
letters of Gay were retained by Swift, and after the death of the Dean
they were printed from the originals. Three only are contained in the
quarto of 1741, and these are joint productions of Gay and Pope,<a name="FNanchor_136_151" id="FNanchor_136_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_151" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
which would naturally have been made over to the latter when he
reclaimed the whole of his correspondence with Swift. If the Dean was
the culprit we must believe that while publishing, or permitting others
to publish, his own letters to Gay, he deliberately excluded every one
of Gay's replies, with the exception of the three in which Pope had a
share. If Pope was the culprit the peculiarity is explained. He
published the three letters which, being in part his own writing, had
been sent back to him in 1737, and he published no others because the
rest of the letters of Gay were not in his possession.</p>

<p>As the Duke of Queensberry was living, the introduction of his name is a
species of guarantee that Swift had received back his letters to Gay;
but the conclusion does not follow, which Pope intended to be drawn,
that the Dean must therefore have supplied them to the printer. "One
thing," says Swift to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[Pg xcv]</a></span> Gay, Nov. 20, 1729, "you are to consider, because
it is an old compact, that when I write to you, or Mr. Pope, I write to
both." On the death of Gay the correspondence passed a second time
through Pope's hands, and with his habit at that period of getting the
letters of his intimates, as well as his own letters, transcribed for
future use, it may readily be imagined that he would not miss the
opportunity of securing a valuable collection, in which he may be said
to have had a common property with his departed friend<a name="FNanchor_137_152" id="FNanchor_137_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_152" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>. Hence it
happens that copies of all Swift's letters to Gay, together with one
that was not printed, are preserved among the Oxford manuscripts, and
with this evidence that the entire series was not less in the power of
Pope than of Swift, suspicion must incline to the one who had made
elaborate preparations for publication, and who had shown himself eager
for it. The suppression too of Gay's replies, contrary to the general
rule observed in the work, would here again favour the opinion that the
letters of Swift were sent to the press by the person to whom the
replies were inaccessible, and not by the person who had the
correspondence on both sides at his command.</p>

<p>The assertion that the letters were returned which Swift addressed to
Pope, is next to be examined. According to the poet his surrender of
them appears from <i>some</i> of the answers of Swift; but the single passage
by which it is implied, is that in which the Dean speaks of "a great
collection of [your/my] letters to [me/you]." The very letter in which
the sentence occurs commences with a lament by Swift that he has
"entirely lost his memory," and the strange double form in which he
describes the correspondence seems chiefly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[Pg xcvi]</a></span> to indicate a consciousness
that his recollection of its nature was uncertain and confused. On one
half of the subject he had manifested his misconceptions a few days
before. He had forgotten the chasm in the series of Pope's letters, had
forgotten that any of them had been restored to their author, had
forgotten Mrs. Whiteway's denial that she possessed them, and when she
again corrected him, continued to fancy they were deposited with some
person he knew not whom, in some place he knew not where. His notions
respecting his letters to Pope were not likely to be better founded than
his notions respecting the letters of Pope to him. But more than this,
he only professed to make the statement upon the authority of his
cousin, and his cousin disavowed all knowledge of the collection. Far
from being aware that the Dean had received back his letters to Pope,
she expressed her conviction that the materials for the printed volume
could not have been drawn from Ireland, just because those letters
formed part of it.<a name="FNanchor_138_153" id="FNanchor_138_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_153" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The literal interpretation of a single phrase of
Swift, in a letter which bears internal evidence of the grievous extent
of his malady, being negatived by the authority upon which it claims to
be based, there still exists the ambiguous assurance of Pope that he
returned the correspondence after the death of Gay, which happened in
December, 1732. The replies, however, of Swift in the quarto, instead of
stopping at this date, extend to August, 1738, and those of the last
half-dozen years must have remained with the poet. The Dean had said in
1717, that he kept no copies of letters. Mrs. Whiteway testified that he
had never taken a copy during the twelve years she had been at his
elbow, "excepting of a letter to a lord-lieutenant or a bishop, whom he
feared might make an ill use of it;" and as for the letters to Pope she
had seen him write them, and send them off immediately. Letters of which
Pope had the originals, and Swift no copies, must plainly have owed
their publicity to Pope.</p>

<p>There is another inconsistency which makes it very doubtful whether the
poet could have sent back the earlier letters of Swift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[Pg xcvii]</a></span> any more than
the later. After informing the Dean, on December 30, 1736, that the
joint letter of August, 1723, had been recently printed by Curll, Pope
went on to say, "Your answer to that letter, he has not got; it has
never been out of my custody; for whatever is lent is lost, wit as well
as money, to these needy poetical readers." Here we have Pope avowing
that he retained in 1736 an answer of the Dean, which belonged to the
year 1723. There is no indication that it was an exception to the rest
of the correspondence, and the presumption therefore is that none of the
letters which Pope received from Swift had been restored upon the death
of Gay in 1732. The poet's assertion is rendered more suspicious by the
absence of all allusion to the circumstance in the arguments which he
addressed through Lord Orrery to Swift, in March, 1737, with a view to
convince him that his refusal to return Pope's own letters was unjust.
No plea could have had greater force than the statement that Pope had
already sent back the letters of Swift, and was only asking the Dean to
deal by him as he had dealt by the Dean.</p>

<p>Although we were to suppose, against the evidence, that the poet had
given up the whole of the originals, he must still have retained copies.
He avowedly inserted six letters of the Dean in the quarto to clear up
the history of the publication, and four of the number belong to the
years 1732 and 1733, which shows that Pope continued to have the command
of the correspondence at the period of its appearance in 1741. Indeed
copies of five of the published letters of Swift to Pope, with eight
that are unpublished, are in the Oxford papers, and since none of the
six, which the poet contributed to the quarto, are among them, more must
have existed, unless he had kept the originals. That he had never parted
with them is the just conclusion from the facts,<a name="FNanchor_139_154" id="FNanchor_139_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_154" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and his note is
one of those instances in which he had recourse to the licence he
allowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii">[Pg xcviii]</a></span> himself of "equivocating genteelly." The letters of Swift to
Gay may be presumed to have been returned to Swift, when the Duke of
Queensberry examined Gay's papers after his death. The expressions in
the Dean's child-like postscript of August 24 gave a colour to the
notion that he had also got back his letters to Pope. The admission
suggested to the poet to draw up a note which, read by the ordinary
rules of language, affirms that the letters to himself were returned, as
well as the letters to Gay, but in which the return of the letters, by a
forced construction, might be made to apply to Gay alone, who is the
immediate antecedent. This accounts for the death of Gay having been
fixed upon for the era of the alleged restoration to the Dean of his
correspondence with Pope, though there was no connection between the
events, and though the choice of so early a date left unexplained the
appearance in the quarto of the subsequent letters of Swift. That "any
mention made by Mr. P. of the return or exchange of letters should be
industriously suppressed" by Mr. P. "in the publication," was a
necessary consequence, or it would have been manifest that the only
letters which had been returned were those of Gay. By evasions like
these the poet satisfied a conscience that held a lie to be justifiable,
provided it was couched in language which could be wrested by the
deceiver into a different sense from what it bore to the deceived.</p>

<p>The correspondence between Swift and Bolingbroke completed the series,
which Pope complained was printed without his consent. Of the eight
letters from Bolingbroke, seven were written in conjunction with the
poet. These joint compositions, like the partnership letters of Gay, are
exactly those which would have been returned to Pope. One of the number
furnishes evidence, which almost amounts to a demonstration, that the
collection of 1741 proceeded from himself. When he brought out the
avowed edition of his letters in 1737, he inserted at the end of the
volume a letter of Swift, a letter of his own, and the joint letter from
himself and Bolingbroke, of which Curll had obtained a copy. This little
supplement was ushered in by a notice which says, "Since the foregoing
sheets were printed off, the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix">[Pg xcix]</a></span> letters having been published
without the consent of their writers, we have added them, though not in
the order of time." Whatever the motive the announcement was deceptive.
The letter of Swift was his reply to the joint letter of Pope and
Bolingbroke&mdash;that very reply which the poet boasted a month or two
before could not be produced surreptitiously, because it had never been
out of his custody. Nobody else, by his own showing, had the power to
make it public, no earlier impression of it is known to exist, and, as
will be seen by comparing it with the copy from the Oxford papers, it
was printed with omissions and variations, which must have been the act
of the poet, or he would have restored the genuine readings when he
included it in his appendix. In juxtaposition with it is a letter from
Pope to Swift, dated December 10, 1725, which in like manner has never
been found in any prior publication, and which of all his letters to the
Dean is the single one we are certain was in his power when the quarto
of 1737 was in the press. He transcribed the original at the time it was
written, and sent a copy to Lord Oxford, ostensibly to let him see the
way in which he was mentioned in it, but partly, perhaps, because the
poet thought well of the production.<a name="FNanchor_140_155" id="FNanchor_140_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_155" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> This letter of December, 1725,
reappears in tho quarto of 1741, with the addition for the first time of
a postscript by Bolingbroke. A copy of the entire performance is among
the Oxford papers, and reveals the fact that the Pope portion, and the
Bolingbroke portion, are both abridged in the published version. Yet
although the persons who brought out the collection of 1741, had the
manuscript before them, or they could not have given Bolingbroke's share
of the letter, they nevertheless, by a marvellous coincidence, print
Pope's share precisely as it had been printed by Pope himself in 1737.
The conclusion is irresistible that the editor of the quarto of 1737,
was the editor of the collection of 1741. The postscript of Bolingbroke
was not written when he was in the house with Pope, but was added
subsequently when he got back to Dawley,<a name="FNanchor_141_156" id="FNanchor_141_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_156" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and its omission from the
volume of 1737<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c" id="Page_c">[Pg c]</a></span> was due to the circumstance, that the poet had not then
received back his correspondence from Swift, and only possessed a copy
of his own carefully composed essay.</p>

<p>The letter of Bolingbroke to Swift, in which the poet had no share, was
commenced at Aix-la-Chapelle on August 30, 1729, and completed at Dawley
on October 5. Pope appears not to have seen it before it was sent; for
four days later, on October 9, he says to Swift, "Lord Bolingbroke has
told me ten times over, he was going to write to you. Has he or not?"
The elaborate epistle of Bolingbroke was a reply to a letter which Swift
had addressed to Pope, and the consequent interest that Pope would have
had in the answer, may have induced the author, proud of his production,
to provide him with a copy; but however he came by it, a copy was
deposited by him in Lord Oxford's library, where, as in the quarto of
1741, it is the single example of an epistle by Bolingbroke alone. Swift
had by him a quantity of Bolingbroke's correspondence, some of which
would have been full as appropriate as the specimen that is given, and
it is a weighty fact in the question whether the Dean or the poet
furnished the materials to the printer, that the one letter selected was
the one letter that Pope possessed. The three letters which are inserted
from Swift to Bolingbroke incline the scale to the same side. The first
relates in part to Pope, the conclusion of the second is addressed to
him, and the third is the answer to the letter of August 30, 1729. It
was never pretended that the Dean received back his letters to
Bolingbroke, and it was not his habit to make copies; but with our
knowledge that the poet and Bolingbroke had much of their correspondence
with Swift in common, we may be sure that these three letters, at least,
had been in the hands of Pope, and if he did not retain the originals,
it would in 1729, the year to which they all belong, have been in
accordance with his common practice to transcribe them.</p>

<p>Thus what was printed of the correspondence, and what was not printed,
concur to show that Pope must have been the source from which it was
derived. The history of the circumstances under which the publication
took place will confirm this inference. Pope asserted that the quarto
was "copied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ci" id="Page_ci">[Pg ci]</a></span> from an impression sent from Dublin." There is now proof in
abundance that the Dublin edition, which came out as the seventh volume
of Swift's works, was copied from an impression sent from England. Mr.
Deane Swift, a cousin of his famous namesake, and the son-in-law of Mrs.
Whiteway, informed Mr. Nichols, in 1778, that "he was the only person
then living who could give a full account how Faulkner's seventh volume,
that is, how Swift's and Pope's correspondence came to be, not <i>first
printed</i>, but first published in Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_142_157" id="FNanchor_142_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_157" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The italics are Mr.
Swift's own, and the fact on which he laid such especial emphasis is at
once attested and explained by the statement of Faulkner himself to Dr.
Birch in August, 1749. "Mr. Pope," he said, "sent to Ireland to Dr.
Swift, by Mr. Gerrard, an Irish gentleman, then at Bath, a printed copy
of their letters, with an anonymous letter, which occasioned Dr. Swift
to give Mr. Faulkner leave to reprint them at Dublin, though Mr. Pope's
edition was published first."<a name="FNanchor_143_158" id="FNanchor_143_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_158" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Faulkner also solicited the sanction
of Pope, and we have the poet's summary of the application, in the
letter he wrote to Mr. Nugent on August 14, 1740: "Last week I received
an account from Faulkner, the Dublin bookseller, that the Dean himself
has given him a collection of letters of his own and mine, and others,
to be printed, and he civilly asks my consent, assuring me the Dean
declares them genuine, and that Mr. Swift, Mrs. Whiteway's son-in-law,
will correct the press, out of his great respect to the Dean and myself.
He says they were collected by some unknown persons, and the copy sent
with a letter importing that it was criminal to suppress such an amiable
picture of the Dean, and his private character appearing in those
letters, and that if he would not publish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cii" id="Page_cii">[Pg cii]</a></span> them in his lifetime others
would after his death." It is manifest from these particulars that
Faulkner was not then aware that Pope himself had sent the
correspondence to Swift, and the conviction was only forced upon his
mind by subsequent events. But the bookseller could not be mistaken on
the point that the letters were handed to him in print. As he later told
Dr. Birch that the Dean had given him leave to reprint them because they
were printed already, so he proclaimed that his volume was a reprint at
the time. He inserted at the end of his <i>first</i> edition the few new
letters which were added in the quarto of 1741, and says that he found
them in the London impression "after he had <i>reprinted</i> the foregoing
sheets." Faulkner had no sort of motive to deceive. Whether the letters
were in type or in manuscript he had equally received them from Swift,
and obtained his authority to publish them.</p>

<p>If further testimony is required it is supplied by Pope. To the mention
of Mrs. Whiteway in Lord Orrery's letter of 1738 the poet appended a
note in which he says, "This lady since gave Mr. Pope the strongest
assurances that she had used her utmost endeavours to prevent the
publication&mdash;nay, went so far as to secrete the book, till it was
commanded from her, and delivered to the Dublin printer, whereupon her
son-in-law, D. Swift, Esq., insisted upon writing a preface to justify
Mr. P. from having any knowledge of it, and to lay it upon the corrupt
practices of the printers in London; but this he would not agree to, as
not knowing the truth of the fact." It was therefore a book, and a
<i>printed</i> book, which was delivered to Faulkner, since if the collection
transmitted to the Dean had been in manuscript, Mrs. Whiteway and her
son-in-law would not have laid it upon the corrupt practices of the
printers, and it must have been transmitted from England, or they would
neither have laid it upon the printers of London, nor have proposed "to
justify Mr. P. from having any knowledge of it." The story was told him
while it could be refuted if it was false; but he did not venture to
question the existence of the printed volume, and had nothing more to
say than that he did not personally know that it was due to the corrupt
practices of the London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ciii" id="Page_ciii">[Pg ciii]</a></span> booksellers. He might have gone further, and
stated that he knew the booksellers to be innocent.</p>

<p>The assertion of Faulkner, that it was Pope who sent this volume to
Swift, is equally supported by unexceptionable evidence. The collection
of 1735 was secretly printed and sold to Curll, and when a secretly
printed work turns out to be the origin of the collection of 1741, the
nature of the device proclaims its author. But the circumstance which
most implicates Pope is his anxiety that it should not transpire that a
printed volume had been sent to Swift at all. He informed his friend
Allen that he had endeavoured to put a stop to the work, and that this
had drawn forth replies from the "Dean's people&mdash;the women and the
bookseller." With their statements before him, he kept back from Allen
the main fact that the Dublin volume was taken entirely from a printed
copy, and speaks instead as if it was taken from the originals. He adds
that it is too manifest to admit of any doubt how many tricks have been
played with the Dean's papers, and accused his "people" of secreting
them as long as they feared he would not permit them to be published.
This dishonest substitution of "originals" and "papers" for the printed
book is a convincing proof that Pope had some motive, incompatible with
innocence, for his studious perversion of the truth. The desire to
obliterate the traces of his delinquency reappears in the preface to the
quarto. He writes with implied censure of Swift for his sanction of the
Dublin edition, and has the disingenuousness to conceal that he had
merely allowed Faulkner to reproduce in Ireland a volume which had been
printed in England&mdash;a volume over which the Dean had no control, and
which being printed, he knew would inevitably be published.</p>

<p>The artful wording of the very note in which Pope refers to the printed
book betrays his desire to keep the fact out of sight. His statement
could enlighten no one who was previously ignorant. It was not from
choice that he promulgated, however obscurely, the allegation of Mrs.
Whiteway that the work had its origin in London. But he was forced upon
one of two evils, and he selected the least. Mrs. Whiteway knew that the
letters must either have been printed by Pope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_civ" id="Page_civ">[Pg civ]</a></span> or have found their way
to the press by the corruption of those who had access to his papers.
She acquitted Pope, out of courtesy, perhaps, to his own protestations,
and accepted the second conclusion, that the London booksellers had
procured the manuscripts by bribes, though she could hardly have
entertained the serious belief that the Curlls had been at the expense
of purchasing and printing them, for no other purpose than to ship a
solitary copy to Ireland. She was eager to be cleared from any possible
imputation of abusing the trust which devolved on her through the
imbecility of Swift,<a name="FNanchor_144_159" id="FNanchor_144_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_159" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and her anxiety to absolve herself and the
Dean, is the secret of her son-in-law insisting upon writing a preface
to prove that the traitors must have been in England and not in Ireland.
He alone would have been responsible for the facts and arguments he
adduced, and they would have appeared in the edition of Faulkner, where
they would not have claimed the sanction of Pope. His ignorance could be
no reason why an independent person should not tell what he knew and
believed, and his unwillingness to be justified was in direct opposition
to his conduct through life. It was for a different cause that he
interfered with the execution of the design. Mr. Swift would have
disclosed the fact that the letters of the poet had been returned to him
through Lord Orrery, in 1737, that he had exclusive possession of the
letters of the Dean, that the ground-work of the collection was at
Twickenham, that it had been printed at London, and had come printed to
Dublin. When he insisted upon fulfilling his intention, Pope, to divert
him from it, must have been driven to propose the insertion of the
exculpatory note. He drew it up in a form which would bear one meaning
to those who were acquainted with the facts, and another to the
multitude who were in the dark. He had the contradictory ends to answer
of propitiating Mrs. Whiteway and concealing the truth, and his
language, like everything he wrote on the question, is consequently
vague and evasive.</p>

<p>In the same letter in which Pope ignored the existence of the printed
book to Allen, and pretended that the Irish edition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cv" id="Page_cv">[Pg cv]</a></span> was taken directly
from the originals, he further asserted that the "Dean's people" had at
length consented to give up the manuscripts. If the originals were
really in their possession there would be strong grounds for concluding
that the conspirators were at Dublin. If, on the contrary, the
allegation of the poet was a wilful untruth, this additional
misrepresentation must lead us to conclude that he was the author of a
fraud from which he defended himself by falsehood. Mrs. Whiteway had, it
is true, commissioned Mr. Nugent to acquaint him that she had secured
several of his letters. Mr. Nugent, having delivered the message in
March, 1740, informs her in April that he was authorised to receive
them, and begs her to transmit them to him in London by a safe
hand.<a name="FNanchor_145_160" id="FNanchor_145_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_160" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> She evidently preferred that they should go direct to their
owner, and wrote to Pope in May, that she would forward them by the
first trustworthy messenger who would deliver them to Pope himself. It
was agreed between them that Mr. M'Aulay should be the person; but they
were ultimately sent to Lord Orrery, at his country seat in Ireland, in
January or February, 1741, and were, no doubt, conveyed by him to their
final destination when he visited England in March. The critic in the
Athen&aelig;um plausibly conjectures that they were the letters which had been
written since the transmission of the collection in June, 1737, and the
late period at which they were received would account for none of them
appearing in the quarto, which was published by the middle of April,
1741.</p>

<p>When Pope, at the beginning of August, 1740, heard from Faulkner that
the Dean had given him permission to print, or rather to reprint, the
correspondence, he expressed his conviction to Mr. Nugent, who was still
meddling in the business, that the offer of returning the letters was a
feint. "I presume now," he added, "that she would have sent but a few of
no consequence, for the bookseller tells me there are several of Lord
Bolingbroke's, &amp;c., which must have been in the Dean's own
custody."<a name="FNanchor_146_161" id="FNanchor_146_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_161" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Mrs. Whiteway had merely undertaken to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvi" id="Page_cvi">[Pg cvi]</a></span> return to Pope
the letters which were written by Pope, and it is not apparent why the
printing of several of the letters of Bolingbroke should have involved
the conclusion that she was practising a feint, and would only have sent
a few of no consequence. The incongruity of the observation seems to
have been the result of the guilt which dictated it. The poet was aware
that the originals promised him were a comparatively small number, which
had no connection with the printed letters, and he was meeting the
circumstance by anticipation, in the probable event of its reaching the
ears of Mr. Nugent. The rest of the correspondence was already in his
possession, and he assigned a foolish reason why Mrs. Whiteway would not
have sent it, because the real reason could not be stated.</p>

<p>It was several months subsequent to this communication to Mr. Nugent,
and after he had received the comments of Mrs. Whiteway on the volume
which came from England, that he opened his griefs to Mr. Allen. The
letter is not dated; but a letter to Warburton, which gives a portion of
the same information as a piece of novel intelligence, bears the date of
February 4, 1741. "They now offer," Pope tells Allen, "to send me the
originals, which have been so long detained, and I will accept of them,
though they have done their job." A few months later he reverted to the
subject and says to Allen, "It will please you to know that I have
received the packet of letters safe from Ireland by the means of Lord
Orrery."<a name="FNanchor_147_162" id="FNanchor_147_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_162" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> He has not the candour to acknowledge that the letters
were voluntarily tendered him by Mrs. Whiteway long before the printed
collection had been heard of. He wished to have it believed that they
had only been offered to him since the booksellers "had done their job,"
and the motive for this deception must have been the desire to identify
the letters from Mrs. Whiteway with the letters in Faulkner's volume,
while he had a secret consciousness that they had nothing in common. It
might be conjectured, indeed, that he was speaking of a distinct
occurrence, and that Lord Orrery was the bearer of two sets of letters,
though Pope mentions only one, if it were not certain, as I shall now
proceed to show, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii">[Pg cvii]</a></span> originals of the printed collection sent to
Dublin were never offered to him at all.</p>

<p>After the collection had been consigned to Faulkner, Mrs. Whiteway wrote
her sentiments at large to Lord Orrery. She asked him, with reference to
a letter of Pope's, if he believed the collection genuine, and slight as
were her doubts, the question would have been absurd if she had
professedly the originals of the correspondence in her hands. She
declared her conviction that the poet had been betrayed by his own
servants, and since the letters extended over three and twenty years,
she could not have imagined that they had all the while been intercepted
on their road to the post, but must have assumed that they had been
abstracted from the cabinets in which they were stored away at
Twickenham. The main stress of her argument against the theory that the
work had been concocted in Ireland, was laid upon the presence of the
letters of the Dean, which Pope alone could command, and not upon the
letters of Pope, which might have been copied while they remained in the
possession of Swift; but she pointed out the improbability of the
supposition by remarking that no use had been made of the book in which
Swift had stitched specimens of the correspondence of various eminent
men, and which was peculiarly accessible from his habit of circulating
it among his friends. In particular, she noticed that she had formerly
his permission to take from it a letter of Pope, and she triumphantly
remarks that this letter had not been printed. The boast could have had
no force if all the printed correspondence had been the same
correspondence she had promised to return. The notion that she had
offered to send back the originals of the collection of 1741 is
inconsistent with every part of her defence&mdash;a defence in which she was
not afraid to challenge contradiction, since she authorised Lord Orrery
to pass it on to Pope. Neither could the originals have been offered by
Faulkner; for both at the time and afterwards he asserted that his
volume was only a reprint. Pope may even be said to bear testimony
against himself. He was eager to make it appear that the work was
composed of materials which must have been drawn from the papers of
Swift, and he took advantage of the erroneous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii">[Pg cviii]</a></span> phrase in Swift's
postscript of August 24, to add, in a note, "The book that is now
printed <i>seems</i> to be part of the collection here spoken of." The
announcement that the "Dean's people" had acknowledged that they
possessed a large proportion of the originals would have decided the
question, and the silence of the poet is an admission that he dared not
repeat in public, where it would meet the eye of the persons implicated,
the fable he had palmed off upon Allen in private. Nay, when stating in
the quarto that Mrs. Whiteway and her son-in-law charged the whole
proceeding upon the corrupt practices of the London printers, he still
did not venture to retort that the originals had never left the custody
of the "Dean's people," who detained them in Dublin until, according to
his own expression, the Dublin printers had "done their job." The fact
was, that Allen had intimated his apprehension that Pope would be
suspected of being concerned in the publication, and Pope replied that
"the whole thing was so circumstanced that this could never be the
case." To stifle the suggestion, he based a falsehood upon a foundation
of truth, and spoke of the letters which Mrs. Whiteway had offered to
send him, in the beginning of 1740, as though they had been the
originals of the printed correspondence. His invention of a fiction to
establish his innocence, is a sure indication of his guilt.</p>

<p>The Dean's people promised Pope the copy of the correspondence, that he
might correct and expunge what he pleased. "I dare not," he wrote to
Allen, "even do this, for they would say I revised it." His mind
immediately veered from decision to uncertainty, and in the next
sentence but one he states that "he knows not whether to make any use of
the permission or not." A little further, and he comes to the conclusion
that until he sees the letters he can form no judgment of the proper
measures to be pursued. "The excessive earnestness," he adds, "the Dean
has been in for publishing them makes me hope they are castigated in
some degree; or he must be totally deprived of his understanding." Lord
Mansfield deposed, from the personal information of Pope, that his
imperfect memory of their contents increased his anxiety to stop the
publication.<a name="FNanchor_148_163" id="FNanchor_148_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_163" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cix" id="Page_cix">[Pg cix]</a></span>In the midst of his apprehensions, his knowledge of
Swift's incapacity, and his conviction that it would be insanity to
allow the correspondence to go forth in its integrity, he yet resolved
not to expurgate the copy, and then doubted whether he would expurgate
it or not. This easy kind of hesitation, which has none of the
appearance of genuine alarm, was what might be expected in a man who had
already revised the letters to his heart's content, and was poorly
performing a borrowed part. Though he ended by refusing to retouch a
text of his own preparing, he employed the interval while the sheets
were submitted to his criticism in forestalling the Dublin edition. Mr.
D. Swift believed that the correspondence was first published in
Ireland. Faulkner asserted that it was first published in England, and
Faulkner, who could not well be mistaken, was right. No advertisement of
the Irish volume is to be found in the "Dublin News Letter" till some
time after the English volume was on sale, and no copy exists in the
public libraries, or after long search could be heard of from the
second-hand booksellers, which does not contain the additional matter
inserted in the quarto.<a name="FNanchor_149_164" id="FNanchor_149_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_164" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In the prefatory notice to the quarto
itself we are told that the letters are taken "from an impression sent
from Dublin, and said to be printed by the Dean's direction." This was
the impression which had been privately forwarded to Pope, and the
language seems to have been carefully selected to avoid the assertion
that there had been a publication of the work. The poet's scheme may be
discerned in the account he gave to Allen. He informed him that the
book, being most of it printed, was "put past preventing," but that he
was "trying all the means possible to retard it." In plain words, he was
man&oelig;uvring to keep back the Irish edition till his rival reprint was
in the market. When he had succeeded in his device, he repeated his old
tactics of advertising that the surreptitious collection was the cause
of his own, and at the same time bespoke the preference for his reprint
by announcing that it would contain "several additional letters."<a name="FNanchor_150_165" id="FNanchor_150_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_165" class="fnanchor">[150]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cx" id="Page_cx">[Pg cx]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from these additions, the quarto of Pope is a reproduction, with
some variations, of the Dublin impression, and a few notes which
Faulkner had doubtless found in the volume sent from England, are said
in the quarto to be taken from Faulkner. Nevertheless there is strong
internal evidence that a portion of the quarto had an independent
origin, and had been printed off before the Irish edition was received.
The correspondence consists of 209 pages, which are numbered
consecutively from 1 to 115. At this point the letters of Swift to Gay
commence, and instead of the numbers proceeding in regular order, they
go back to page 89, and are thence continued without any break to the
final page, 182. That the arrangement is not a typographical mistake is
clear from the signatures of the sheets being in accordance with the
paging,&mdash;a coincidence which was barely possible if the figures had been
a misprint. The correspondence of Swift with Gay begins on sheet N,
which is the letter of the alphabet that answers to page 89 in a quarto
volume, and this keeping between the letters and the figures is
preserved throughout. But there is a second coincidence which is
absolutely fatal to the idea that the confusion in the paging was an
error of the press. The quarto edition was accompanied by an edition in
folio, which was the same impression with the matter parcelled out into
pages of greater length, and with the requisite changes in the numbering
of the pages and the signatures of the sheets. In spite of the change
there is the identical peculiarity that distinguishes the quarto. The
numbers run on unbroken from 1 to 108, when we arrive at the letters to
Gay. Here we recommence with page 85, and starting from this new basis
the figures proceed in regular succession to the end. The sheet at page
85 is marked Y, the proper letter for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxi" id="Page_cxi">[Pg cxi]</a></span> folio size, and as in the
quarto the signatures, in every instance, correspond with the pages. The
defect cannot be explained by the supposition that the work had been
divided into portions, which were printed separately for the sake of
expedition. With the text of the Dublin copy to guide his calculations,
no compositor could have committed the error of pronouncing that matter
which covers 115 pages could he contained in 88. The evident cause of
the anomaly is that, after the quarto in its original form had passed
through the press, Pope saw reason to cancel the opening part of the
volume which preceded Swift's correspondence with Gay. The materials in
their second form occupied more space than in their first, and instead
of filling only 88 pages in the quarto, and 84 in the folio, run on to
115 in the one, and 108 in the other. The consequence is that the pages
in excess bear the same numbers with the succeeding uncancelled pages
which could not be altered. The process is rendered further apparent by
the signatures to the sheets. In both folio and quarto, those on the
surplus pages, in the cancelled division of the volume, have an asterisk
affixed to denote that the signatures had been already employed;<a name="FNanchor_151_166" id="FNanchor_151_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_166" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
but though the sheets have this mark of repetition, they are placed in
the volume before the uncancelled sheets which retain the primitive
signatures, and which did not admit of any change. In the quarto, again,
a half sheet precedes the letters to Gay, which could not have happened
unless it had been a subsequent interpolation, when the matter was
insufficient to make the sheet complete. The half-sheet, the duplicate
paging, and the duplicate signatures, are all the result of the
insertion of fresh materials after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxii" id="Page_cxii">[Pg cxii]</a></span> work was struck off, and betray
that there was an earlier form of the quarto of 1741, which contained
less than the Dublin edition, and which, therefore, being prior to it,
is a proof that the correspondence was originally printed by Pope. The
letters in the quarto are numbered, and since the series is unbroken
throughout, the original cancelled division must ostensibly have
comprised as many letters as when it was subsequently enlarged. But a
letter to Gay, dated Nov. 23, 1727, is found by the copies preserved in
the Oxford papers, to be compounded of three distinct letters, and this
system of fusion would have permitted the introduction of large
additions without deranging the continuity Of the numbers, which Pope
would have been anxious to preserve. The cancels he made to suit his
varying views were in accordance with his practice. The miscellaneous
prose works, which follow the letters, have in one place alone a cancel
of upwards of a hundred pages. Equally characteristic was the desire to
preserve any of the old sheets which could be retained, regardless of
the blemish to the book, and the trace they might afford of his
man&oelig;uvres. It was a repetition of the paper-sparing policy which led
him to incorporate the suppressed sheets of his Wycherley into the
volume of 1735.<a name="FNanchor_152_167" id="FNanchor_152_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_167" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>On the 22nd of March, 1741, Pope called upon Lord Orrery at his house in
London, and found him writing to Swift. The poet took the pen from his
hand, and continued the letter. After large professions of affection, he
went on to say, "I must confess, a late incident has given me some pain;
but I am satisfied you were persuaded it would not have given me any,
and whatever unpleasant circumstances the printing our letters might be
attended with, there was one that pleased me,&mdash;that the strict
friendship we have borne each other so long is thus made known to all
mankind. As far as it was your will, I cannot be angry at what, in all
other respects, I am quite uneasy under. Had you asked me, before you
gave them away, I think I could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxiii" id="Page_cxiii">[Pg cxiii]</a></span> proposed some better monument for
our friendship, or, at least, of better materials." Any words addressed
to Swift were lost upon him now, and Pope in reality was speaking to
Lord Orrery, and to those who might hereafter read his protestations. He
had apparently forgotten that just four years before he had complained
to the same Lord Orrery, that the Dean had denied his request when he
wished to insert some of the letters in the quarto of 1737.<a name="FNanchor_153_168" id="FNanchor_153_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_168" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The
monument he was eager to erect to their friendship in 1737, he
repudiated in 1741. He affirmed that he could have proposed a better,
but never hinted what it was; or at least of choicer materials, but
never troubled himself further about them. This was the smallest part of
the contradiction. He refused his consent to the reprint of the book
sent to Dublin, and had even tried, he told Allen, to stop it by threats
of law. It is true, he confessed to Mr. Nugent at the outset, and
continued to confess to Allen, that he had no hope of prevailing; but
his efforts are not the less the measure of his pretended disgust. Yet
he instantly appropriated the correspondence he was anxious to stifle in
its birth, contrived to anticipate the Dublin edition, incorporated the
entire collection into his works, and published it simultaneously in
folio, quarto, and octavo. He stated in the prefatory notice, that he
had refused to revise the letters, because they were committed to the
press without his consent; but the annoyance which would not permit him
to revise the letters was no check to his haste in adopting, or to his
zeal in circulating them. For a man who was "quite uneasy" at their
appearance, his eagerness to countenance, to parade, and to propagate
them was amazing, and the manifest duplicity is not the least forcible
of the arguments which bring the whole contrivance home to Pope.
Warburton applauded him for the little resentment "he expressed at the
indiscretion of his old friend." He affected far more than his advocate
supposed; but if it had been otherwise it is strange that Warburton
should not have perceived that to talk of resentment was ridiculous when
the poet was espousing "the indiscretion,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxiv" id="Page_cxiv">[Pg cxiv]</a></span> and was doing his utmost to
disseminate the letters he feigned a wish to suppress.</p>

<p>Curll republished the letters under the title of "Dean Swift's Literary
Correspondence." Pope filed a bill in Chancery against Curll on June 4,
1741. The poet not only demanded protection for his own letters, but
desired that the bookseller should be restrained from vending the
letters of Swift, who was not a party to the suit, nor had commissioned
any one to interfere on his behalf. The case was memorable both from its
intrinsic importance, and from the celebrity of the plaintiff. In his
answer, on the 13th of June, Curll admitted that nobody had authorised
his work. He rested his defence on three propositions. He maintained
that private correspondence did not come within the Copyright Act of
Queen Anne, because the Act was declared in the title to be for the
"Encouragement of <i>Learning</i>," whereas letters on familiar subjects were
not <i>learned</i> productions; and because the Act was designed to protect
books which were avowedly composed for the press, whereas letters were
written without the intention of converting them into a literary
commodity. He said that he was informed, and believed, that the letters
were first "printed"<a name="FNanchor_154_169" id="FNanchor_154_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_169" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> at Dublin, and he contended that all persons
in England had a right to reproduce books which were first "published"
in Ireland. He finally argued that letters were in the nature of a gift
to the receiver, and that after they were delivered to the Dean they
became his property. On the motion to dissolve the injunction on these
grounds, Lord Hardwicke decided that they were none of them valid. He
refused to recognise a distinction between letters and other
compositions. He denied that a prior publication in Ireland could
deprive an English author of his English rights. He, above all,
determined that though the paper on which the letter was written might
possibly be the property of the receiver, the matter remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxv" id="Page_cxv">[Pg cxv]</a></span> the
property of the writer. For the same reason that he admitted Pope's
title to his own letters, he declined to continue the injunction with
respect to the letters addressed to him, which had never ceased to
belong to the persons who penned them.<a name="FNanchor_155_170" id="FNanchor_155_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_170" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The celebrated Murray was
one of the counsel for the poet,<a name="FNanchor_156_171" id="FNanchor_156_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_171" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and afterwards, when Lord Chief
Justice, he quoted and confirmed the decision of the Chancellor. "The
question," he said, "was whether the property was not transferred to the
correspondent. Lord Hardwicke thought not, and that the writer was still
the proprietor."<a name="FNanchor_157_172" id="FNanchor_157_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_172" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> "Dean Swift," he said subsequently, "was certainly
the proprietor of the paper upon which Pope's letters to him were
written; but no disposition, no transfer of paper upon which the
composition is written can be construed a conveyance of the copy,
without the author's express consent to print and publish, much less
against his will."<a name="FNanchor_158_173" id="FNanchor_158_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_173" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Just and valuable as is the rule of law which
prohibits the publication of a letter without the permission of its
author, the manner in which Pope invoked it was singular. According to
his statement it was Swift that had prepared and put forth a
correspondence, in which more of the letters were from the pen of the
Dean than from the pen of the poet. Pope, while professing to be vexed
beyond measure at this exposure of private papers, asked for an
injunction, not for the purpose of suppressing them, but to obtain a
monopoly of the sale. He was not even content to reclaim his personal
share in the publication of the friend whom he upbraided for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxvi" id="Page_cxvi">[Pg cxvi]</a></span> the act.
He tried to prevent any one except himself from profiting by Swift's
part of the book, and at the same time that he was endeavouring to
secure goods which did not belong to him, he reproached their owner for
displaying them. His conduct once more betrayed the truth he laboured to
conceal. He was the compiler of the collection, and instinctively
regarded a rival edition as an invasion of his rights. His proceedings
were unnatural, if Swift was the sole originator of the work; but if it
had a different source we can perceive why Pope was jealous of the least
interference with property which, from the outset, he considered to be
exclusively his own.</p>

<p>A fatality attended the correspondence of Pope. Curll, in defiance of
him, printed his letters to Cromwell. Lord Oxford, in spite of his
disapproval, printed his letters to Wycherley. An unknown person, by
unknown means, obtained the whole of the collection of 1735, printed it
secretly at his own expense, and sold it for a song. To render the
history uniform and complete, Swift, who would not permit Pope to print
their letters, printed them himself, while Pope, changing sides with
him, remonstrated and threatened. That nothing might be wanting to the
singularity of the case, the three last sets of letters stole into the
world when they were under the vigilant guardianship of the poet, and
the two last sets got abroad after the abiding paroxysm of terror,
engendered by the indiscretion of a single dissolute friend, had induced
him to wrest his correspondence from friends of every degree for the
purpose of securing it from the possibility of publication. Mrs.
Whiteway remarked to Lord Orrery, that among the letters in the Dean's
stitched book were numbers from the greatest men in England for genius,
learning, and power,&mdash;from Bolingbroke, Oxford, Bathurst, and
Peterborough; from Addison, Congreve, Prior, Parnell, and Gay. She said
these were as easily pilfered, and would have been as interesting to the
world, as the letters of Pope and Swift;<a name="FNanchor_159_174" id="FNanchor_159_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_174" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> but nobody invaded the
sanctity of the private correspondence of the poet's contemporaries,
even when the papers were open to half the gossips of Dublin. He stood
alone in a misfortune which happened to him no less than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxvii" id="Page_cxvii">[Pg cxvii]</a></span> four times,
and which it is to be feared would have happened a fifth if he had lived
long enough to accumulate the materials for a fresh volume. He relaxed
his correspondence with Caryll in 1729, and with Swift in 1737, as a
means to compel them to resign his former letters, and to both he used
the same expression,&mdash;that "he did not write upon the terms of other
<i>honest</i> men."<a name="FNanchor_160_175" id="FNanchor_160_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_175" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The fallacy of the parallel was in the epithet. If
he had resembled other men in their honesty he might have shared in
their immunity from the alleged treachery of friends like Oxford and
Swift, and of enemies like Curll.</p>

<p>Of all the deceptions which the poet practised to get his correspondence
under the eye of the world, his dealings towards Swift are the worst. He
had failed to gain his consent to putting forth the letters while any
judgment yet remained to him; but no sooner had he sunk into dotage
than, trusting to his inability to detect the cheat, Pope beguiled him
into sanctioning the publication by sending him the volume ready
printed, with a flattering exhortation, the echo of what he had written
on a former occasion,<a name="FNanchor_161_176" id="FNanchor_161_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_176" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> "importing that it was criminal to suppress
such an amiable picture of the Dean and his private character."<a name="FNanchor_162_177" id="FNanchor_162_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_177" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The
moment Swift fell into the pit his friend had dug for him, his friend
denounced him for the act. "I think," he wrote to Mr. Nugent, "I can
make no reflections upon this strange incident but what are truly
melancholy, and humble the pride of human nature,&mdash;that the greatest of
geniuses, though prudence may have been the companion of wit (which is
very rare) for their whole lives past, may have nothing left them at
last but their vanity. No decay of body is half so miserable!"
Extraordinary language to come from the pen of the man whose vanity,
without any excuse from the decay of his faculties, had made him eager
to print the letters in 1737, and who had been only thwarted in his
desire because Swift was wanting in the vanity by which he himself was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxviii" id="Page_cxviii">[Pg cxviii]</a></span>
impelled,&mdash;infamous language when the deed he reprobated was his own,
and Swift the innocent dupe; and when having traded successfully in the
mental afflictions of his friend, he proceeded to hold up his victim, as
the criminal. But the simulated indignation is less revolting than the
simulated fondness. "When the heart is full of tenderness," he said to
the Dean, in the letter of March 22, 1741, "it must be full of concern
at the absolute impotency of all words to come up to [it]. I value and
enjoy more the memory of the pleasure and endearing obligations I have
formerly received from you than the perfect possession of any other.
Think it not possible that my affection can cease but with my last
breath. If I could think yours was exhausted I should grieve, but not
reproach you. If I felt myself even hurt by you I should be confident
you knew not the blow you gave, but had your hand guided by another."
The hand which guided him was the same hand that was at that moment
aiming a blow at his reputation. Taking advantage of his cruel malady
and prostrate understanding, Pope was even then endeavouring to fasten
upon him the stigma of his own personal treachery, and this pretended
magnanimity in forgiving a deed which he had contrived and instigated
was in itself a calumny and a fraud.</p>

<p>If any doubt could exist that it was Pope who put forth the collection
of 1735, and the Swift collection of 1741, we have still in the quarto
of 1737 his own avowed version of a large portion of his correspondence.
He published it with the express object of correcting the corrupt text
of spurious editions, and there remains the inquiry whether he published
it truly. When he burnt three-fourths of it, and deposited copies of the
rest in the library of Lord Oxford, he professed to have preserved the
originals from which the copies were taken. Lord Bolingbroke discovered
a great number of returned letters among his papers after his death, and
told Dr. Heberden that they contained many alterations and corrections,
which he supposed had been made with the intention of printing them some
time or other.<a name="FNanchor_163_178" id="FNanchor_163_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_178" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> From this it would be inferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxix" id="Page_cxix">[Pg cxix]</a></span> that those which had
been printed were not part of the collection, and that the poet had
found it inexpedient to retain vouchers, which would condemn if they did
not acquit him. Unfortunately the whole of the manuscripts were
destroyed by Lord Bolingbroke, and beyond the unsatisfactory information
conveyed in his remark, nothing can now be known of them. The literal
interpretation of his language is favoured by the evidence yet within
our reach, and we should conclude that Pope had not kept originals which
would have revealed alterations in the published letters of a far more
serious nature than any which Bolingbroke appears to have suspected.</p>

<p>John Caryll, a Roman Catholic country gentleman residing in Sussex, was
among the intimate correspondents of Pope for twenty-five years, from
1710 to 1735. The poet wrote to him on Nov. 19, 1712, and asked to have
the "whole cargo of his epistles returned," which he said might be of
use "in a design he had lately engaged in." This design was probably to
furnish some essays to the "Guardian," which commenced on the 12th of
March, 1713. He promised to restore the letters when he had done with
them, and his friend at once complied with his desire. After the
surreptitious publication of his correspondence with Cromwell, Pope, in
December, 1726, renewed his petition to Caryll to make over to him "all
such papers as he had too partially preserved;" but the object of the
request this time was "to put them out of the power of Curll." The poet
announced that he would send back those which could do no hurt to the
character of himself, his friend, or any other person; that he would
retain those which "would serve to bear testimony of his own love for
good men, or theirs for him;" and implied, as a consequence, that he
would destroy those which did not fall under either of these heads. By
this division the insignificant letters alone would have been restored
to Caryll, and whether he was mistrustful of the use to which Pope might
apply the remainder, or whether he was anxious to preserve intact the
memorials of his intimacy with a celebrated man, he did not think fit to
accede to the demand. A diminution in the frequency and cordiality of
their correspondence ensued, and lasted for upwards of two years. Caryll
at length complained, and Pope replied in February 1729, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxx" id="Page_cxx">[Pg cxx]</a></span> he could
not open his mind to his acquaintances unless they would return him at
the end of every year "the forfeitures of his discretion, and commit to
his justice what he trusted only to their indulgence." Upon this
intimation that compliance was to be the condition of intimacy, Caryll
yielded the point, and the receipt of the letters was acknowledged by
the poet on the 8th of April. The Sussex squire defeated the purpose for
which they were extorted by copying the greater part of the collection.
He persevered in the practice till near the close of his life. The last
letter from Pope which he caused to be transcribed is dated July 17,
1735, and he died on the 6th of April, 1736. When his grandson sold the
hereditary estate in 1767, and retired from England to the continent,
the family papers were left behind, stowed away in boxes, where they
remained for nearly three quarters of a century. They then came into the
possession of Mr. Dilke, and have since been presented by his grandson,
Sir Charles W. Dilke, to the British Museum. Among the manuscripts were
a dozen folio books, containing the farm and domestic accounts, and in a
volume similar in appearance Mr. Dilke discovered the copies of the
letters of Pope, together with copies of others from the Dukes of
Berwick, Beaufort, and Norfolk, from Dryden, Wycherley, Steele, Roger
Lestrange, St. Evremond, and Le Grand. The external and internal
evidence leaves no doubt of their authenticity. One unexpected
confirmation of their genuineness turned up in an autograph letter of
Pope to the younger Caryll, dated Nov. 8, 1712, and which was sent by
Mr. Tuckwell to Mr. Croker. The letters to the younger Caryll remained
with his widow. The few which exist are originals in the custody of
different collectors, and this letter of Nov. 8 is a link in a series of
facts that are only known through the transcripts in the Caryll folio.
The recovery of documents, which Pope did not suspect were in existence,
discloses to us his mode of dealing with his correspondence when, having
no idea that it could rise up against him, he ventured to use it without
reserve.</p>

<p>After calling in his letters to his friends, Pope proceeded to arrange
them in order, and said "they formed altogether an unimportant, but yet
an innocent history of himself." "You make,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxi" id="Page_cxxi">[Pg cxxi]</a></span> I assure you," he wrote to
Caryll, July 8, 1729, "no small figure in these annals from 1710 to 1720
odd. Upon my word, sir, I am glad to see how long, and how often, and
how much I have been obliged to you, as well as how long, how often, and
how much I have been sensible of and expressed it." Notwithstanding this
assurance, Caryll made a very small figure indeed in the published
collection. Four letters only were addressed to the "Hon. J. C., Esq."
in the volume of 1735, and these initials, in the quarto of 1737, were
added to a fifth letter which had previously been headed, "Mr. Pope to
----." One other letter, in the quarto, bore the title to "Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;";
but it was separated from the former group, and it is from the Caryll
copy that we learn how to fill up the blank. Both in the edition of 1735
and 1737 Pope published a letter to the "Hon. James Craggs, Esq.," which
induced Roscoe to conclude that he was the person indicated by the
initials, and it is not improbable that the poet designed to mislead his
readers, especially as the claim of Caryll to be styled Honourable was
only a Jacobite assumption, derived from his being heir to his uncle,
who had been created a peer by the exiled James II. But though Pope did
not wish to repeat in public his profuse professions in private, and
appear as the familiar friend and constant correspondent of a Roman
Catholic country gentleman, he as little desired to suppress the choicer
portions of the effusions he had addressed to him. He conceived the idea
of re-directing them, and compiled from them, in whole or in part, four
fictitious letters to Blount, four to Addison, two to Congreve, and one
each to Wycherley, Steele, Trumbull, and Digby. A second letter to
Digby, which appeared in the edition of 1735, was transferred to
Arbuthnot in the quarto of 1737. Half a dozen letters at most were
allotted to the initials of the Sussex squire, while fifteen were
assigned to more imposing names, and a sixteenth was printed in a group
of three to the "Hon. &mdash;&mdash;" Rather than credit an imposition so
childish, and yet so unwarrantable, we should have recourse to the
theory that Pope sometimes sent the same letter to different persons.
Swift assured him that the best system extant for the conduct of human
life might be collected from his epistles, and they certainly abound in
generalities which, like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxii" id="Page_cxxii">[Pg cxxii]</a></span> clown's answer, that suited all questions,
might have been written to anybody. But a comparison of the printed
letters with the Caryll copies, shows that this solution is
inadmissible, and the observation of the clown, when his answer proved
inopportune, is equally applicable to the contrivance of Pope&mdash;"I see
things may serve long, and not serve ever."<a name="FNanchor_164_179" id="FNanchor_164_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_179" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The "Spectator" of the 10th of November, 1712, contained some remarks by
Pope on the verses which the Emperor Hadrian composed when he was dying.
The poet asked Caryll's opinion of the criticism, and the substance of
his reply is embodied in the rejoinder of Pope. "The supposition you
draw from the suspicion that Adrian was addicted to magic, seems to me a
little uncharitable,&mdash;that he might fear no sort of Deity, good or
bad,&mdash;since in the third verse he plainly testifies his apprehension of
a future state by being solicitous whither his soul was going. As to
what you mention of his using gay and ludicrous expressions, I have
already owned my opinion that the expressions are not so, but that
diminutives are often in Latin taken for expressions of tenderness and
concern." This comment is introduced, in the printed correspondence,
into the letter to Steele of November 29, 1712, and if it was sent to
him as well as to Caryll both must have objected to the gay and
ludicrous expressions of Hadrian, both must have spoken of the suspicion
that he was addicted to magic, both must have inferred from it that he
feared no sort of Deity, good or bad, and the language of both must have
been as identical as their ideas.</p>

<p>"I know," Pope wrote to Caryll, August 22, 1717, "you will take part in
rejoicing for the victory of Prince Eugene over the Turks, in the zeal
you bear to the Christian interest, though your cousin of Oxford, with
whom I dined yesterday, says there is no other difference in the
Christians beating the Turks or the Turks beating the Christians, than
whether the Emperor shall first declare war against Spain, or Spain
declare it against the Emperor." In the published version the passage
forms part of a letter to Edward Blount dated September 8, 1717, and
either we must admit that it was never written to him, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxiii" id="Page_cxxiii">[Pg cxxiii]</a></span> believe that
Caryll and Blount had each an Oxford cousin, that the poet dined with
the Oxford cousin of Caryll on August 21, and with the Oxford cousin of
Blount on September 7, that both these cousins made, at their respective
dinners, the same epigrammatic observation in the very same words, and
that the extraordinary coincidence struck Pope so little that he did not
even remark upon it.</p>

<p>Another passage of a letter to Caryll, dated September 20, [1713]
reappears in a letter to Blount dated February 10, 1716. "I am just
returned from the country, whither Mr. Rowe did me the favour to
accompany me, and to pass a week at Binfield. I need not tell you how
much a man of his turn could not but entertain me; but I must acquaint
you there is a vivacity and gaiety of disposition almost peculiar to
that gentleman, which renders it impossible to part from him without
that uneasiness and chagrin which generally succeeds all great
pleasures. I have just been taking a solitary walk by moonshine in St.
James's Park, full of reflections of the transitory nature of all human
delights, and giving my thoughts a loose into the contemplation of those
sensations of satisfaction which probably we may taste in the more
exalted company of separate spirits, when we range the starry walks
above." Thus Pope, who on his return to town in September, 1713, after a
week's companionship with Rowe, took a solitary walk by moonlight and
meditated on the transitory nature of human delights, and the happy
intercourse of spirits, was led by the power of association, after
another week spent at Binfield with Rowe in February, 1716, to renew the
solitary walk by moonlight the instant he returned, and indulge in the
old contemplation on the transitory nature of human delights, and the
happy intercourse of separate spirits. What renders more singular the
second moonlight walk is that the date assigned to it was the memorable
season when the Thames was frozen over, and when the quantity of snow
was as unusual as the intensity of the cold. The thaw commenced the day
before the fragile little bard sallied out for his stroll, and he must
indeed have been lost in contemplation "of the starry walks above" not
to have been checked in his moonlight rambles by the deplorable
condition of the walks below. None of the phenomena<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxiv" id="Page_cxxiv">[Pg cxxiv]</a></span> which were
attracting the attention of the rest of the world,&mdash;the breaking up of
the long and terrible winter, the deluge of melting snow, the chilling
atmosphere, the dreary prospect,&mdash;received a passing notice from him. He
saw nothing except the moonshine, despite its watery gleam, and thought
of nothing except the spirits in the stars.</p>

<p>In the collection of 1735 there appeared a letter to Digby, which is
dated September 10, 1724, and is compounded from two letters, to Caryll
of November 23 and December 25, 1725. In the letter of November 23, Pope
says to Caryll, "My time has been spent in a trembling attendance upon
death, which has at last seized one of our family,&mdash;my poor old nurse."
This sentence was inserted in the letter to Digby, but as the nurse did
not die till November 5, 1725, the information could not have been
communicated to him in September, 1724. The motive of the poet in
altering the dates of his letters when he assigned a fanciful address to
them was probably to adapt the chronology to the circumstances of his
new <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. His earliest letter to Edward Blount is dated
August, 1714, and when he transferred the moonlight reverie from 1713 to
1716, he may have been influenced by the consideration that in the
former year his correspondence with Blount had not commenced. The letter
to Caryll of November 23, and the letter to Digby of September 10, both
open with the same compliment on their return from the Continent, and
the date may have been altered from 1725 to 1724 to make it harmonise
with Digby's travels abroad. In remedying one inconsistency, Pope fell
into another. A new use was found for the letter in the quarto of 1737.
Arbuthnot died in February, 1735, at the very time when there is reason
to suppose that the poet printed the P. T. collection. The final letter
in the volume is from the Doctor, and it was apparently added at the
last moment. It was then too late to be thinking of a re-distribution of
the materials, and the idea was not executed, or perhaps conceived till
1737, when the address, which had been changed from Caryll to Digby, was
once more changed from Digby to Arbuthnot. In the interval Pope appears
to have detected the anachronism. He retained the day of the month, but
struck out the year. He preserved the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxv" id="Page_cxxv">[Pg cxxv]</a></span> announcement, "death has seized
one of our family," but dropped the words "my poor old nurse." Her death
nevertheless could alone have been meant; for in the letters to Caryll,
as in the letter to Digby, several contemporaneous particulars are
mentioned, which being repeated in the letter to Arbuthnot, limit its
date to the period of the poor old nurse's decease. In both cases Pope's
time had been spent in attending upon the dying patient, in both cases
he and his mother had been ill together, in both cases these incidents
had hindered his writing, in both cases he had been questioned
respecting the effect produced upon his mind by the attacks upon his
translation of the "Odyssey," and in both cases he had been less
troubled by the criticisms upon his writings than by the imputations
upon his morals, in consequence of some reports which had been spread of
his intrigues with Martha Blount. It follows that the letter to
Arbuthnot, though dated September 10, must have been written subsequent
to the death of the nurse on November 5. But there is unanswerable
evidence that at that time, and for weeks and months afterwards, he had
constant personal intercourse with the poet. He was at his elbow, and
not on the Continent,<a name="FNanchor_165_180" id="FNanchor_165_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_180" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and the event could not have been
communicated to him as news upon his return from any journey he ever
made to France. The year was omitted by Pope exactly because he could
fix upon none which would bear the test of examination.<a name="FNanchor_166_181" id="FNanchor_166_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_181" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> When it is
plain that the letter could not have been addressed to Arbuthnot, it is
superfluous to dwell upon the improbability that he and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxvi" id="Page_cxxvi">[Pg cxxvi]</a></span> Caryll should
have put the same question with regard to the "railing papers about the
'Odyssey,'" or to enumerate the other coincidences which are beyond the
range of belief. The letter in all its shapes contains a passage which
forms a strange comment upon Pope's proceedings, and is the bitterest
sentence that will ever be pronounced upon them: "Falsehood is folly,
says Homer, and liars and calumniators at last hurt none but themselves,
even in this world. In the next, it is charity to say, God have mercy on
them. They were the devil's vice-regents upon earth, who is the father
of lies, and, I fear, has a right to dispose of his children."</p>

<p>On June 12, 1713, Pope wrote to Caryll, "As I hope, and would flatter
myself, that you know me and my thoughts so entirely as never to be
mistaken in either, so it is a pleasure to me that you guessed so right
in regard to the author of that 'Guardian' you mentioned." On June 23 he
wrote again, and said, "Your last is the more obliging as it hints at
some little niceties in my conduct which your candour and affection
prompt you to recommend to me." Both these sentences are inserted in an
undated letter to Addison, which is compiled from three letters to
Caryll, and no one could credit that Caryll and Addison had
independently, and almost simultaneously communicated their guesses to
Pope that he was the author of a particular essay in the "Guardian," and
at the same time "hinted at little niceties in his conduct." The
remainder of the letter to Addison is full of inconsistencies. The
result of the imposition is to confound dates, events, opinions, and
persons. Addison knows Pope and his thoughts so entirely as never to be
mistaken in either; Addison's candour and affection prompt him to advise
Pope in little niceties of conduct, and the perfect knowledge, the
affection, the candour, and the advice, which are represented as
proceeding from the most exquisite genius of the age, all appertain to
an obscure country gentleman whose intimacy could not confer, in the
eyes of the world, any lustre upon his friend. The whole of the letters
to Addison are an absolute fiction. Four out of the five are from the
Caryll correspondence, and the internal evidence is opposed to the
genuineness of the fifth. The deception is aggravated by the erroneous
aspect it imparts to the celebrated quarrel. In the letters which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxvii" id="Page_cxxvii">[Pg cxxvii]</a></span>
preceded the commencing rupture Pope appears as the zealous champion and
bosom associate of the man he afterwards maligned, and we are left to
suppose that the vaunted generosity on one side had been met by envy and
hostility on the other. It is of virtual forgeries like these, which
were specially concocted for the public, that the poet had the hardihood
to say in his preface, "Many of them having been written on the most
trying occasions, and all in the openness of friendship, are a proof
what were his real sentiments, as they flowed warm from his heart,
without the least thought that ever the world should be witness to
them." He not only pretended that they derived a value from being the
spontaneous expression of his feelings as they rose, but pledged his
word that his motive in treasuring them up was to supply an authentic
register of historical, literary, and personal events, and especially to
provide a corrective to the misrepresentations of less scrupulous
chroniclers. "I think more and more of it," he said to Lord Oxford,
September 15, 1729, when dwelling upon the value of the collected
letters and the importance of preserving them, "as finding what a number
of facts they will settle the truth of, both relating to history and
criticism, and parts of private life and character of the eminent men of
my time." In the preface to the quarto of 1737 he made a statement of
the same nature, and protested that the letters he kept were selected
from the letters he destroyed, "merely as they preserved the memory of
some friendships which would be ever dear to him, or set in a true light
some matters of fact from which the scribblers of the times had taken
occasion to asperse either his friends or himself." He volunteered the
declaration to Lord Oxford when he was engaged in the manufacture of the
correspondence which was to falsify the facts he pretended it "would
settle the truth of," and he renewed the assertion in public as a
prelude to the fabrications themselves.</p>

<p>The Wycherley correspondence furnishes fresh illustrations of the
malpractices of the poet. For Pope's own share in it the published
version is our only authority. The originals of Wycherley's part in it
were placed in Lord Oxford's library in October, 1729, and withdrawn in
June, 1735; but there still exist among the Oxford papers copies of six
out of the eighteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxviii" id="Page_cxxviii">[Pg cxxviii]</a></span> published letters, besides six which are
unpublished.<a name="FNanchor_167_182" id="FNanchor_167_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_182" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Imperfect as is the series, it is sufficient to show
the infidelity of the work Pope put forth to the world. The letter
borrowed from the Caryll group may conveniently be considered in
connection with the rest. It was probably not included in the original
volume of the Wycherley correspondence, which Pope published in 1729,
for it is printed in the edition of 1735 on an interpolated half sheet
signed * <span class="smcap">c</span>. This is placed between sheet <span class="smcap">b</span> and sheet <span class="smcap">c</span>, and the numbers
of its four pages&mdash;11 to 14&mdash;are repeated on sheet <span class="smcap">c</span>. The space being
greater than was required the letter has been divided into an unusual
number of paragraphs, which are double the ordinary distance from each
other, and as this device for spreading out the matter only brought it
three or four lines over the top of the fourth page the remainder is
left blank, contrary to the plan adopted in the rest of the book.<a name="FNanchor_168_183" id="FNanchor_168_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_183" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
Pope we may presume had not completed in 1729 his task of reconstructing
his letters to Caryll, and first introduced the manufactured letter into
the old sheets of the Wycherley when he incorporated them into the
volume of 1735. A single circumstance is enough to prove that the letter
is fictitious. It is made up of extracts from two letters to Caryll of
July 31, 1710, and January 25, 1711, and in the former of the two the
poet quotes a remark from the "Tatler" on the reason why women are
vainer than men. The passage is repeated in the letter to Wycherley
which is dated June 23, 1705, nearly four years before the "Tatler"
commenced, and Pope imagined he had obliterated the anachronism by
changing the phrase "the 'Tatler' observes of women" into the general
formula "it is observed of women."</p>

<p>The concoction of the letter to Wycherley out of the letters to Caryll
is attended by the usual distortion of facts. The extract from the
letter of July 31 is an expostulation against Caryll's extravagant
compliments. A few months after the date which Pope assigned to the
passage when he applied it to Wycherley, the old dramatist had addressed
a kindred remonstrance to Pope. "I must confess," he wrote March 22,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxix" id="Page_cxxix">[Pg cxxix]</a></span>
1705-6, "you try my patience, as you say in the beginning of your
letter, not by the many lines in it, but the too many compliments you
make me for nothing, in which you prove yourself, though a sincere
friend, a man of too much fiction; for I have not seen so much poetry in
prose a great while, since your letter is filled with so many fine words
and acknowledgments of your obligations to me, the only asseverations of
yours I dare contradict; for I must tell you your letter is like an
author's epistle before his book,&mdash;written more to show his wit to the
world than his sincerity or gratitude to his friend, whom he libels with
praise, so that you have provoked my modesty even whilst you have
soothed my vanity; for I know not whether I am more complimented than
abused, since too much praise turns irony, as too great thanks for small
favours turns ingratitude, or too much ceremony in religion
hypocrisy."<a name="FNanchor_169_184" id="FNanchor_169_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_184" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Pope thought fit in the published letters to reverse
the parts. He ascribed the adulation to Wycherley, and the rebuke of it
to himself. He gives a false air of manly independence to his youthful
character, and does it at the expense of his friend.</p>

<p>The extract from the letter to Caryll of January 25, 1711, which forms
the second portion of the made-up letter to Wycherley of June 23, 1705,
is a comment on the eulogy lavished by Caryll on some verses of the
poet. The change of name and date flattered in a double manner the
vanity of Pope,&mdash;the applause appeared to proceed from a celebrated wit
instead of from a country squire, and to be bestowed upon a lad of
seventeen instead of upon a man who was nearly twenty-three. He always
aspired to the credit of precocity, and some of his falsifications seem
to have had no other purpose than to exaggerate his juvenile fame.
Wycherley wrote to him on February 19, 1708-9, and spoke of the genius
which promised him immortality, of his great, vigorous and active mind.
In a postscript it is mentioned that the "Miscellany," which contained
Pope's Pastorals, would not be out for three weeks.<a name="FNanchor_170_185" id="FNanchor_170_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_185" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Pope
suppressed, amongst other passages, the allusion which fixed the period
at which the panegyric was penned, and altered the year to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxx" id="Page_cxxx">[Pg cxxx]</a></span> 1706-7, for
no perceptible reason except that he wished to antedate the praise.
There can be little doubt that his opening letter to Wycherley was
manufactured or misplaced with a similar object. It is printed in the
edition of 1735 on an interpolated half sheet, marked *<span class="smcap">b</span>, the pages of
which are correctly numbered from 1 to 4. As the first page of sheet <span class="smcap">b</span>
which follows is numbered 3, it is evident that it was originally
preceded by only two pages, which must have been cancelled, and the
present letter put in their place.<a name="FNanchor_171_186" id="FNanchor_171_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_186" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> This new letter is dated
December 26, 1704, and contains his reflections on a compliment which he
alleges had been paid to him by Wycherley&mdash;that his compositions were
above the attacks of envious critics. "It is pleasant to remark," says
Dr. Johnson, "how soon Pope learned the cant of an author, and began to
treat critics with contempt, though he had yet suffered nothing from
them."<a name="FNanchor_172_187" id="FNanchor_172_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_187" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> He did not in fact publish a single line till more than four
years later, and with our present evidence that the letter was an
interpolated after-thought, we cannot but suspect that Wycherley's
premature compliment, and Pope's premature cant both belonged to a
subsequent period, or perhaps were fabricated for the press. "The
author's age then sixteen," says the poet in a note, and in this
ostentatious announcement we have the motive to the act. The opinion of
Warburton, that the letters of the boy displayed all the characteristics
of the man, is an argument the more that they were the productions of
the man and not of the boy.</p>

<p>"I have received," writes Wycherley, in an unpublished letter, dated
December 6, 1707, "yours of the 29th of November, which has so much
overpaid mine in kindness that, as Voiture says, I doubt whether the
best effects of those fine expressions of your friendship to me can be
more obliging than they themselves; and for my humility you talk of, you
have lessened while you magnify it, as by commending my good nature with
so much more of yours you have made me almost incapable of being
grateful to you; for you have said so many kind things of me you have
hardly left me anything of the same kind to return you, and the best
actions are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxi" id="Page_cxxxi">[Pg cxxxi]</a></span> capable of making you amends for so many good words you
have given me, by which you justly magnify them and yourself by saying
they are sincere, so that you have obliged me to be vain rather than not
think you a Plain Dealer. Thus, even against your own opinion, your
freedom with me proves not you a fool, but me so, especially if I could
think half the good you say of me my due. As for the good book you sent
me I took it as kindly as the reprimand from the good man, which I think
you heard, and was that I should not stand in my own light."<a name="FNanchor_173_188" id="FNanchor_173_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_188" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Pope
printed his letter of November 29, to which this letter was a reply, and
it touches upon none of the topics to which Wycherley refers. There are
none of the fine expressions of friendship, none of the many honied
words, none of the encomiums on his correspondent's good nature and
humility. He reproves him, on the contrary, in rather a lofty tone for
his excessive acknowledgments for trifling services, tells him he will
continue the revision of the poems the old dramatist had submitted to
him, insists that he must be permitted to alter and add as well as omit,
and in answer to an observation of Wycherley, that "the sprightliness of
wit despises method," assures him that if method is neglected his verses
had better be converted into separate maxims in prose. As Pope's letter
does not contain one syllable upon the subjects to which Wycherley
alludes in his reply, so the reply takes no notice of the subjects which
monopolise the epistle of Pope. Though he had discoursed exclusively
upon the remodelling of Wycherley's poems, Wycherley himself disdains to
offer in return a single word of thanks, of encouragement, of
acquiescence, or dissent. The omission cannot be explained by the
supposition that the copy was abridged. Whatever passages might have
been left out, those would certainly have been retained which confirmed
under Wycherley's own hand the particulars which were Pope's professed
justification for printing the letters, and his excuse for depositing
them in the library of Lord Oxford.</p>

<p>The Wycherley correspondence concludes with a letter from Pope dated May
2, 1710. A coldness then ensued of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxii" id="Page_cxxxii">[Pg cxxxii]</a></span> Dr. Johnson gives this
account: "The fondness of Wycherley was too violent to last. His esteem
of Pope was such that he submitted some poems to his revision, and when
Pope, perhaps proud of such confidence, was sufficiently bold in his
criticisms and liberal in his alterations, the old scribbler was angry
to see his pages defaced, and felt more pain from the detection than
content from the amendment of his faults. They parted, but Pope always
considered him with kindness, and visited him a little time before he
died."<a name="FNanchor_174_189" id="FNanchor_174_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_189" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The statement is incomplete. Pope engaged in the revision as
early as April, 1706, when he describes to Wycherley the nature of the
emendations he has made: "Some parts I have contracted as we do
sun-beams to improve their energy and force; some I have taken quite
away, as we take branches from a tree to add to the fruit; others I have
entirely new expressed, and turned more into poetry." In November, 1707,
he informs his friend that he has subjected the poem on "Dullness" to
the same process, that he has condensed the piece one half, suppressed
deficiencies, heightened the language, and smoothed the versification.
Far from being angry at these "bold criticisms and liberal alterations,"
the old scribbler was profuse in his thanks, and replied to Pope's
request, that he would keep the assistance a secret, by declaring that
he always does, and always will own to whose genius and judgment he is
indebted for the improvement of his unmusical numbers and harsher sense.
Between three and four years afterwards he submitted a fresh set of
poems to Pope's castigation, and in two successive letters of April 1
and April 11, 1710, entreats him to show no mercy in his corrections;
"for I had rather," he says, "be condemned by my friend in private, than
exposed to my foes in public." Pope answered that the repetitions were
more numerous than he anticipated, and that crossing them out defaced
the copy to a degree that he feared would be displeasing. "Let me know,"
he added, "if I am to go on at this rate, or if you would prescribe any
other method." Wycherley rejoined that tautology was the last fault of
which he would be guilty, that he thought with care he could remove the
blemish, and that he would not occupy Pope in a task which might
"prevent his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxiii" id="Page_cxxxiii">[Pg cxxxiii]</a></span> writing on new subjects of his own." "All," he continues,
"that I desire of you is to mark in the margin, without defacing the
copy at all, any repetition of words, matter, or sense, which if you
will be so kind as to do for me, you will supply my want of memory with
your good one, and my deficiencies of sense with the infallibilities of
yours,&mdash;which if you do you will most infinitely oblige me, who almost
repent the trouble I have given you, since so much." The comment on
Pope's strong criticism is equally cordial: "As to what you call freedom
with me, which you desire me to forgive, you may be assured I would not
forgive you unless you did use it; for I am so far from thinking your
plainness a fault or an offence to me that I think it a charity and an
obligation, which I shall always acknowledge with all sort of gratitude
to you for it, who am therefore, dear Mr. Pope, your most obliged humble
servant." Dr. Johnson overlooked the rude ordeal to which Wycherley's
vanity had been exposed in April, 1706, and the proof he then gave that
he had not in his character the slightest tincture of irritable
impatience at the wholesale correction of his works. He implored a
renewal of the rigour when he invoked, with full experience of the
treatment he was to expect, the same good offices in April, 1710, and
the anger which Johnson imputes to him on that occasion at the detection
of his faults is not only in singular contradiction to the whole of his
previous conduct, but is belied, as we have seen, by his letter to Pope.
The notion that he was offended at the freedom of his friend's remarks
was an inference drawn from the tone of Pope's reply, and not from the
language of Wycherley himself.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Pope commences, "you persist to take ill my not accepting
your invitation, and to find, if I mistake not, your exception not
unmixed with some suspicion." The letter of Wycherley is dated April 27,
1710, and if the contents of the letter of Pope, which is dated May 2,
did not show that it was the answer, all doubt would be removed by the
fact that it was headed "The Answer" by the poet, both in the octavo of
1735, and the quarto of 1737. This led to the conclusion that Wycherley,
while professing to receive the strictures on his verses with kindness,
had at the same time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxiv" id="Page_cxxxiv">[Pg cxxxiv]</a></span> manifested in his letter some displeasure which
his friend thought proper to omit, and which connected their quarrel
with the secret soreness of the author at the candour of the
critic.<a name="FNanchor_175_190" id="FNanchor_175_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_190" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Pope did indeed suppress the beginning and the end of
Wycherley's communication; but the passages he kept back betray the
falsity of his own insinuation. "I answered," the letter begins, "yours
of the 15th, which I think was the last I had from you, about three days
after my receiving it; but having not yet received any answer to it from
you, I doubt your old pain of the head-ache has prevented it, which
gives me a great deal of concern for you, insomuch that I have had
thoughts of making you a visit before my journey into Shropshire, which
has been delayed by delays and disappointments to me out of the
country." The end is as follows: "My most humble service pray to Sir
William Trumbull, and your good father and mother, whilst I can assure
you from hence all the world here are your servants and friends. I know
not but I may see you very suddenly at Binfield after all my broken
promises."<a name="FNanchor_176_191" id="FNanchor_176_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_191" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Instead, therefore, of Wycherley being annoyed at Pope's
refusal to accept his invitation, it was Wycherley who was designing to
visit Pope; and instead of his persisting to take ill any part of his
friend's conduct, his language was throughout expressive of cordiality
and kindness.</p>

<p>The first intimation of a rupture is in a letter of Pope to Cromwell, on
August 21, 1710, in which he says, "Since Mr. Wycherley left London, I
have not heard a word from him, though just before, and once since, I
writ to him, and though I know myself guilty of no offence but of doing
sincerely just what he bid me." On October 28, he reverts to the
subject, and protests by everything that is holy that he is not
acquainted with the cause of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxv" id="Page_cxxxv">[Pg cxxxv]</a></span> estrangement. He goes on, however, to
state that he did not suppose any man could have been so suspicious as
not to credit his own experience of a friend, and avers that he had done
nothing which deserved to be concealed&mdash;a defence which seems to
indicate a consciousness that Wycherley had heard some disparaging
report. It was subsequently asserted by Pope's enemies, and never
contradicted by Pope, that the alienation was produced by a copy of
satirical verses he had written on the man he affected to caress. His
offensive reply of May 2, to the genial letter of April 27, might alone
explain the resentment of Wycherley, if the ungracious answer in its
printed shape could be received as authentic. But I have shown that the
opening sentence, in which Pope regrets that his correspondent persisted
in taking ill his not accepting an invitation, is altogether fictitious,
and with the evidence before us in the critical epistle of November 29,
1707, that he replaced his complimentary effusions by unvarnished
truths, we may suspect that the uncompromising tone of his final letter
was softened in the original, and that the published version is merely
another instance of his anxiety to conceal the deference he had shown to
Wycherley before the celebrity of the old dramatist had been eclipsed by
the fame of the youthful poet. The almost eastern style which Pope
adopted towards him a year and a half after the close of their
correspondence, may be seen in one of his genuine epistles to Cromwell,
which was printed by Curll. "I am highly pleased," the poet writes,
November 12, 1711, "with the knowledge you give me of Mr. Wycherley's
present temper, which seems so favourable to me. I shall ever have such
a fund of affection for him, as to be agreeable to myself when I am so
to him, and cannot but be gay when he is in good humour, as the surface
of the earth, if you will pardon a poetical similitude, is clearer or
gloomier, just as the sun is brighter or more overcast." Whatever may
have caused the sun to be overcast, there could have been little ground
of complaint against Wycherley, or Pope would not have fabricated the
pretence that he had provoked his anger by declining an invitation.</p>

<p>On the appearance of Theobald's edition of the Posthumous Works of
Wycherley, the poet poured out his indignation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxvi" id="Page_cxxxvi">[Pg cxxxvi]</a></span> to Lord Oxford. "I
foresaw," he said, October 6, 1729, "some dirty trick in connection with
my friend Wycherley's papers which they were publishing, and nothing can
at once do justice so well to him and to me, who was by him employed in
them, as the divulging of some parts of his and my letters." At the
moment that he was penning this denunciation against "dirty tricks in
relation to Wycherley's papers," though no trick had been practised, he
was busily engaged in aspersing his friend by garbling the papers he
professed to divulge out of justice to his memory. His motives were not
malignant. He was simply desirous to do credit to himself, but to effect
this end he did not scruple to falsify their private correspondence, and
under the plea of justifying a man who was in his grave, took advantage
of his death to libel him in safety. When with our scanty means of
testing the fidelity of the letters, we find that part of them were
misplaced, distorted, and invented, the rest of the series must be
received with distrust, and some which cannot be proved to be fabricated
are among the most suspicious of the whole.</p>

<p>Where the originals of Pope's letters were in hostile hands, as was the
case with his letters to Cromwell and to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, he
was compelled to be sparing in his operations. He omitted sentences and
altered phrases, but could not venture upon wholesale perversions of the
truth. Of the bulk of the letters he published we have neither the
originals nor reliable copies; but when we chance to light upon the
materials from which he worked, we find, as might be expected, that he
was not more conscientious in his use of them than in his reckless
falsification of his correspondence with Wycherley and Caryll. The
volume of 1735 concludes with a letter from Arbuthnot, dated July 17,
1734, and in the quarto of 1737 we have the pretended reply of the poet.
Among the Arbuthnot papers in the possession of Mr. Baillie, is the
actual answer sent by Pope, and it turns out that the printed substitute
is an elaborate composition that has hardly any resemblance to the
genuine text. He must have revised the letter of Arbuthnot as well as
remodelled his own. "I am almost displeased," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxvii" id="Page_cxxxvii">[Pg cxxxvii]</a></span> remarks in the real,
not in the counterfeit reply, "at your expression '<i>scarcely</i> any of
those suspicions or jealousies which affect the truest friendships;' for
I know of <i>not one</i> on my part." He accordingly erased from Arbuthnot's
letter the expression he disapproved, and fathered upon him the
unqualified assertion, "I think since our first acquaintance there has
not been any of those little suspicions or jealousies that often affect
the sincerest friendships." To what extent he may have carried this
principle of altering the opinions of his correspondents to fit his
personal views cannot be discovered. A single instance of the artifice
in a man so unscrupulous destroys all confidence in the documents which
rest on his unsupported authority, and there is often reason to suspect
that he gives us not what others said, but what he thought it
advantageous to himself that they should say.</p>

<p>In comparison with this perversion of facts, the attempt of Pope to
improve his letters, regarded as literary productions, would be of
trifling moment, if it did not present another example of the audacious
falsehoods he imposed upon the world. Speaking in the preface to the
quarto of 1737 of the correspondence he reprinted from what he calls the
surreptitious editions, he says "for the chasms in it, we had not the
means to supply them, the author having destroyed too many letters to
preserve a series." He intends us to infer that the selection was not
his own, though the passage is virtually an admission that the
collection of P. T. was the collection deposited with Lord Oxford, or
there could not have been such an identity between them as that none of
the gaps in the P. T. volume could be filled up from the bound book in
the Oxford library. "Nor," he continues, "would he go about to amend
them, except by the omission of some passages improper, or at least
impertinent to be divulged to the public, or of such entire letters as
were either not his, or not approved of by him." He would have us
believe that they had been dragged before the world in their first crude
state, without a single subsequent touch from his pen, though he had
previously amended them with studious care&mdash;had culled the best
passages, blended extracts from two or three letters into one, and
constantly corrected composition which had been originally laboured.
Some of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxviii" id="Page_cxxxviii">[Pg cxxxviii]</a></span> ambitious epistles, like his letter to Arbuthnot of July
26, 1734, were no doubt mere essays, which were only written when they
were committed to the press. In the quarto of 1741, he repeated the
device he had employed in the quarto of 1737. He pretended in both cases
that the correspondence he printed himself had been printed by others
without his knowledge, and in defiance of his wish. He next adopted and
republished the letters he affected to repudiate, and having already
revised them to the uttermost, asserted that he could not be induced to
revise them at all. So completely had truth with him been swallowed up
in vanity. "Had he," he tells us in the preface to the quarto of 1737,
"sat down with a design to draw his own picture, he could not have done
it so truly, for whoever sits for it, whether to himself or another,
will inevitably find his features more composed than his appear in these
letters; but if an author's hand, like a painter's, be more
distinguishable in a slight sketch than a finished picture, this very
carelessness will make them the better known from such counterfeits as
have been, and may be, imputed to him." He did everything he professed
to have left undone. The careless sketch was a studied portrait got up
for exhibition, and the minutest details had been disposed with a view
to flatter the likeness and increase the effect.</p>

<p>In the conduct of Pope to Bolingbroke there are points of resemblance to
his conduct in the case of the correspondence, which render the evidence
a material supplement to the present inquiry. Bolingbroke allowed him to
get put into type the political letters on "The Spirit of Patriotism,"
on "The Idea of a Patriot King," and on "The State of Parties," under
the promise that the pamphlet should be confined to five or six persons,
who were named by the author. Pope fulfilled his pledge by causing a
separate edition of 1500 copies to be struck off, and enjoined the
printer to lay by the sheets "with great secresy till further
orders."<a name="FNanchor_177_192" id="FNanchor_177_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_192" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> In the dangerous man&oelig;uvre of printing covertly the
original volume of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxxxix" id="Page_cxxxix">[Pg cxxxix]</a></span> the Swift correspondence which he sent to the Dean,
he may, perhaps, have remained concealed from the inferior agents, and
have conducted the details of the business through the medium of
Worsdale. In the instance of the pamphlet he was not afraid to put
himself into the power of the printer, who, says Bolingbroke, "kept his
word with him better than he kept his with his friend."<a name="FNanchor_178_193" id="FNanchor_178_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_193" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The poet
not only committed a breach of trust in preparing a work for sale which
he received upon the condition that it should remain strictly private,
but he had the boldness to tamper with the substance of the work, and in
the impression, which was ultimately designed for the public, "he took
upon him to divide the subject, and to alter and omit passages according
to the suggestions of his own fancy."<a name="FNanchor_179_194" id="FNanchor_179_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_194" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> From Warburton we learn that
Pope "frequently told his acquaintance that Lord Bolingbroke would at
his death leave his writings to his disposal,"<a name="FNanchor_180_195" id="FNanchor_180_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_195" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and the changes he
introduced by anticipation into the single instalment within his power
show the manner in which he designed to discharge his functions, and
strengthen the suspicion that he may have falsified the letters of his
correspondents as well as his own. Johnson, in censuring Lyttelton for
publishing the posthumous edition of Thomson's poem on "Liberty," in an
abridged form, condemns a practice "which, as it has a manifest tendency
to lessen the confidence of society, and to confound the characters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxl" id="Page_cxl">[Pg cxl]</a></span> of
authors, by making one man write by the judgment of another, cannot be
justified by any supposed propriety of the alteration or kindness of the
friend."<a name="FNanchor_181_196" id="FNanchor_181_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_196" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The freedom used by Pope was especially reprehensible from
the concealment he practised. The copy of the pamphlet which he sent to
Bolingbroke, and the other privileged persons, did not exhibit the
modified text, and though the occurrence took place several years before
the death of the poet he never, in all that time, whispered one word
upon the subject to the author of the tracts, from which it is clear
that he neither intended him to learn what he had done, nor expected him
to approve the changes he had made. It was not till he was in his grave
that his deception was divulged by the application of the printer to
Bolingbroke for instructions how to dispose of the impression. Warburton
argued that Pope must have wished his friend to have a knowledge of the
clandestine edition and clandestine alterations, or he would have
ordered the work to be destroyed during his final illness,<a name="FNanchor_182_197" id="FNanchor_182_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_197" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> as if,
in the lingering hope that life would be protracted a little longer, it
had not happened times out of number that men had deferred burning
tale-telling papers till their minds were diverted from the duty by the
lassitude of sickness, and as if such procrastination was not in the
highest degree probable when the poet had been first at the pains of
revising the work, and next at the cost of an edition of 1500
copies.<a name="FNanchor_183_198" id="FNanchor_183_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_198" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> He may even have believed that his secret, under any
circumstances, was safe with the printer. A theory which has been
verified by endless examples is a more credible alternative than to
assume that Pope had designed to leave behind him evidences of a
dishonesty which he had not dared to disclose during years of familiar
intercourse, and which, notwithstanding that Bolingbroke was perpetually
at his side, he did not venture to reveal in his dying hours when he
might have palliated his motives, and obtained pardon for his fault. But
if we admit the supposition of Warburton, and allow that he had
ultimately arrived at the resolution of suffering the course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxli" id="Page_cxli">[Pg cxli]</a></span> of events
to betray the misdoings he had not the courage to confess, there will
still remain the facts, which Warburton never questioned, that he
pretended to Bolingbroke that some half dozen copies had alone been
printed, when he had printed a distinct edition of 1500; that he handed
an impression to the author which was taken faithfully from the
manuscript, while the impression he hid from him was garbled and
adulterated; and that, having concealed the double treachery for years,
he left the world without an allusion to the wrongful act he had
committed. Johnson justly considered that the resentment of Bolingbroke
at this violation of faith was with reason "more acrimonious in
proportion as the violator had been more trusted or loved," for the
professions which win confidence increase the baseness of betraying it;
but with equal justice Johnson condemned the "thirst for vengeance"
which excited Bolingbroke "to blast the memory" of the man who had lived
with him in a constant interchange of affection, and who, both in public
and private, had paid him the tribute of his heartiest homage and
applause.<a name="FNanchor_184_199" id="FNanchor_184_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_199" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The scrutiny to which the lives of celebrated men are subjected is one
of the severest penalties they pay for fame. Their private weaknesses
have often been exposed with wanton cruelty; but the delinquencies of
Pope are public acts by which he himself has challenged inquiry. He
endeavoured to pass off a sophisticated correspondence for genuine, and
the interests of truth demand that the deception should be exposed. He
laboured to throw his own misdoings upon innocent men, and justice
requires that his victims should be absolved, and the discredit,
augmented beyond measure by the perfidy and deceit, be laid where it is
due. He was the bitter satirist of individuals out of an assumed
indignation at everything base, and his claim to adopt this lofty
strain, his sincerity in it, and his fairness, are all involved in his
personal dealings. The office of an editor is neither that of an
advocate nor of an accuser. He is a judge, whose only client is truth. I
have endeavoured to investigate the facts with impartiality, and narrate
them with fidelity, and if I have anywhere failed, it is from
unconscious, not from wilful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlii" id="Page_cxlii">[Pg cxlii]</a></span> error; but having once been satisfied of
the guilt of Pope, I do not pretend to think that genius is an
extenuation of rascality. He rightly refused others the benefit of the
plea, and said in the Essay on Man, whoever is "wickedly wise is but the
more a fool, the more a knave." The sketch which Lord Macaulay has given
of his character, when describing his conduct on the appearance of
Tickell's version of the first book of the Iliad, is not too severe for
the treacheries and falsehoods which were the instruments of his
malevolence, cowardice and vanity. "An odious suspicion had sprung up in
the mind of Pope. He fancied, and he soon firmly believed, that there
was a deep conspiracy against his fame and his fortunes. The work on
which he had staked his reputation was to be depreciated. The
subscription, on which rested his hopes of a competence, was to be
defeated. With this view, Addison had made a rival translation; Tickell
had consented to father it, and the wits at Button's had consented to
puff it. We do not accuse Pope of bringing an accusation which he knew
to be false. We have not the smallest doubt that he believed it to be
true; and the evidence on which he believed it he found in his own bad
heart. His own life was one long series of tricks, as mean and as
malicious as that of which he had suspected Addison and Tickell. He was
all stiletto and mask. To injure, to insult, and to save himself from
the consequences of injury and insult by lying and equivocating, was the
habit of his life. He published a lampoon on the Duke of Chandos; he was
taxed with it; and he lied and equivocated. He published a lampoon on
Aaron Hill; he was taxed with it; and he lied and equivocated. He
published a still fouler lampoon on Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; he was
taxed with it; and he lied with more than usual effrontery and
vehemence. He puffed himself, and abused his enemies, under feigned
names. He robbed himself of his own letters, and then raised the hue and
cry after them. Besides his frauds of malignity, of fear, of interest,
and of vanity, there were frauds which he seems to have committed from a
love of fraud alone. He had a habit of stratagem, a pleasure in
outwitting all who came near him. Whatever his object<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxliii" id="Page_cxliii">[Pg cxliii]</a></span> might be, the
indirect road to it was that which he preferred. For Bolingbroke, Pope
undoubtedly felt as much love and veneration as it was in his nature to
feel for any human being. Yet Pope was scarcely dead, when it was
discovered that from no motive, except the mere love of artifice, he had
been guilty of an act of gross perfidy to Bolingbroke."<a name="FNanchor_185_200" id="FNanchor_185_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_200" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Many of the
falsehoods and perfidies I have detailed have come to light since
Macaulay wrote, and there are more behind which will appear in their
proper place in Pope's life and works. There have been no lack of men
whose moral conduct was in an almost inverse ratio with their
intellectual gifts; but there never was an author of equal genius, who
habitually practised such despicable deceptions for such paltry
purposes;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who for this end would earn a lasting name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Join moral infamy to mental fame,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>His crooked policy was ineffectual, even when his worst devices were
undetected. Few believed that he was vexed at the publication of his
letters, or that they were careless effusions, or that the virtues he
paraded in them were the just reflection of his mind. Both men and
compositions will seem to be what they are, and the poet's protestations
did not prevent the world from discovering that his epistles were
laboured, that many of his sentiments were feigned, and that he eagerly
promoted the publications he pretended to deplore.</p>

<p>Having finished a discussion which from its nature will be dull to many,
and from its length will be wearisome to all, I turn to speak of the
present edition of the Correspondence. The last edition published in the
lifetime of Pope comprised, according to Mr. Croker's calculation, 354
letters. These, Mr. Croker states, were increased by Warburton to 384,
by Warton to 502, by Bowles to 644, and by Roscoe to 708, or exactly
double the number that were included in the last edition of the poet.
The present edition will contain more new letters than were collected by
Warburton, Warton, Bowles, and Roscoe combined, and many of them are of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxliv" id="Page_cxliv">[Pg cxliv]</a></span>
immeasurably greater importance in determining the character and conduct
of Pope than any which have previously appeared. There are others among
them which, under ordinary circumstances, would be too trivial to be
printed; but particulars, which are separately insignificant, have
assisted in dispelling some of the mystery or exposing some of the
deceptions in which it was the poet's pleasure to involve his life, and
as nobody can pronounce with certainty what facts may be of service to
future inquirers, I have thought it better to add a few superfluous
pages than to run the risk of rejecting materials which may prove useful
hereafter. I have, in like manner, admitted letters which had a
biographical value, although they were neither written by Pope nor to
him. Second-hand statements cannot supply the place of authentic
documents, and to have dissociated the subsidiary from the main
correspondence would have frequently deprived both of the increased
importance they derive from being read in connection.</p>

<p>In Pope's own, and every succeeding edition, the letters are divided
into groups. The arrangement of the entire collection in one consecutive
chronological series is, in his case, neither desirable nor possible. It
is not desirable because a unity of subject often runs through his
intercourse with particular persons, and the interposition of the topics
upon which he touched with other friends, far from presenting a
connected view of his thoughts and actions, would reduce the whole to a
medley of disjointed fragments. It is not possible because many of his
letters are undated, and, though we can frequently determine their place
in each class, there are no means of settling their order when all the
letters of doubtful date are thrown together. In numerous instances the
year in which they were written can at most be discovered, and the
attempt to fix their precedency within that period would be attended
with as much uncertainty as if they were shuffled like a pack of cards.</p>

<p>The liberties which Pope took with his correspondence in preparing it
for publication diminish the authority of that extensive portion of it
which we owe to his printed or manuscript copies alone, and have
rendered it essential to specify<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlv" id="Page_cxlv">[Pg cxlv]</a></span> the source from which, every letter is
derived. Where the letter was sent to one person and was published by
Pope as if it had been addressed to another, it is inserted in its
proper place, and again in the group to which it was falsely assigned by
the writer. Unless the correspondence was exhibited in its double form,
a just idea could not easily be obtained of the shape and colour he
imparted to it, or of the relations which he pretended to have
maintained with his contemporaries. Where the direction was not changed,
and we possess both the genuine and the corrected letter, the true
version is given in the text, and any variations in his amended version
which seemed worthy of notice are pointed out in the notes. Even here,
from the nature and extent of the alterations, it has sometimes been
necessary to preserve a letter in its twofold state.</p>

<p>The greater part of the collection of 1735 was reproduced in the quarto
of 1737; but as the texts are not always identical the earliest has been
followed, except where there is manifestly an error of the press, or
where the quarto supplies passages which are not in the volume of P. T.
I had once intended to subjoin the whole of the various readings at the
foot of the page. I abandoned the design upon finding that the vast
majority of them were verbal, and apparently unimportant changes, which
could only have interested the few curious inquirers who would always
have recourse to the original editions. I have not the less carefully
collated these original editions throughout, and have thus got rid of
numerous mistakes which had become traditional in the subsequent
reprints. The notes signed "Pope, 1735," were first published in the P.
T. collection, with the exception of a few in the Wycherley group,
which, though they are only known to us through the P. T. volume, had
undoubtedly appeared in 1729. Many of the P. T. notes were transferred
to the authorised impression of 1737, and they were nearly all in the
copies which the poet delivered to Warburton for posthumous publication.
The notes signed "Pope, 1737," were added in the quarto of that year;
and those signed "Cooper, 1737," are from the octavos which bear the
name of this bookseller on the title-page.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlvi" id="Page_cxlvi">[Pg cxlvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Language was current in Pope's day which would be considered grossly
indelicate in ours, and though he abounds in refined and elevated
strains, he was yet among the worst offenders of his time. "He and
Swift," says Dr. Johnson, "had an unnatural delight in ideas physically
impure, such as every other tongue utters with unwillingness, and of
which every ear shrinks from the mention." His correspondence is not
altogether free from the defect; but no editor can now efface the blots
which Warburton, Warton, and Bowles felt bound to preserve. Roscoe set
aside a few sentences, and showed by his inconsistency the uselessness
of the process. He confined his expurgations to the part of Pope's works
which were little read, and where the omissions in consequence would
rarely be remarked; but did not venture to disturb a single syllable of
the far more numerous and more objectionable passages which occur in the
pieces that are in the hands of all the world. The stains which sully so
much of our beautiful literature are unhappily indelible, and it could
answer no useful end to adopt the capricious principle of Roscoe in
removing the lesser blemishes which are seldom noticed, and leaving the
worst and most conspicuous defilements undisturbed. More freedom may be
used with the unpublished letters; but I have exercised the discretion
very sparingly, and have not excluded every coarse word, phrase, or
idea, when it was characteristic of the age, the man, and his writings,
and when, though an offence against taste, it could not be injurious to
morals.</p>

<p>I have mentioned at the several places where their contributions are
inserted, the numerous persons to whose liberality Mr. Croker and myself
have been obliged for materials and assistance. The services rendered by
Mr. Dilke require to be noticed here. Until he published his articles in
the Athen&aelig;um little had been added to our knowledge of Pope since
Johnson produced his masterly Life. The truths which Mr. Dilke
established, and the errors he dissipated, were not more important than
the change he gave to the former superficial investigations. His rigid
scrutiny became the standard for every subsequent inquirer. He loved his
studies for their own sake, and never did a man of letters work less for
personal ends. He at once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cxlvii" id="Page_cxlvii">[Pg cxlvii]</a></span> placed at my disposal his Caryll
correspondence, which he had carefully annotated, and the explanation of
all its obscure allusions are due to him. He supplied me with a
multitude of letters which were widely scattered through books and
periodicals, and collated others with the originals in the British
Museum and Bodleian Library. Large masses of the letters are undated, or
dated falsely, and he was at the labour of fixing dates which sometimes
appeared to defy conjecture. He lent me his rare editions, was unwearied
in answering questions, in solving difficulties, in revising proofs, and
in communicating, without reserve, his stores of information. He was
then suffering from a long and painful illness, and he died when only
the first volume of correspondence was printed, or I should have had his
generous and invaluable aid to the end.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowles remarked in the course of the skirmish of pamphlets he
provoked, that the editorship of Pope's works had been to no one a bed
of roses. For the larger part of the discomforts his commentators may
have endured, Pope himself was responsible. His mysteries, his
double-dealings, his falsifications, and his quarrels have rendered half
the acts of his life a fertile theme for debate. None of the angry
controversialists who mingled fifty years ago in the fray had prepared
properly for the contest, and the insolence and assumption, the
virulence and the dogmatism, were commonly greatest with the persons
whose acquaintance with the subject was the least. The intemperate, and
usually ignorant warfare, left nearly all the vexed questions in
confusion, and it is only in recent years that a new generation of
dispassionate students have begun to replace the blunders of sciolism by
facts. In the many battles yet to be fought over Pope there will be this
advantage which will be certain to produce solid results, that the
critic will be in possession of the materials for judgment, and will not
have to write without knowledge of his cause.</p>

opinions, nor the most pathetic memorial from his personal experiences,

Swift. "I detest the House of Lords," he wrote to Lady Betty Germain,
from Dublin, June 8, 1735, "for their indulgence to such a profligate,
prostitute villain as Curll; but am at a loss how he could procure any
letters written to Mr. Pope, although by the vanity or indiscretion of
correspondents the rogue might have picked up some that went from him.
Those letters have not yet been sent hither; therefore I can form no
judgment on them." Swift's detestation of the House of Lords for not
punishing a man who was proved to be innocent of the offence with which
he was charged, is an instance of the kind of justice to be expected
from violent partisans.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_94" id="Footnote_79_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_94"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> When Pope put forth his preface to the quarto he could not
have intended to disguise that he was the writer of the "Narrative," or
he would have been at greater pains to vary his language. If the general
resemblance had been less marked, an invention common to both
productions would reveal their common origin. In the "Narrative" we are
informed that the complete collection of Pope's had been copied into a
couple of books before Theobald published his edition of Wycherley's
posthumous works, and that it was from these manuscript books that the
Wycherley correspondence was transcribed for press. This assertion was
untrue. Theobald's volume came out in 1728, while Pope's collection, as
appears from his announcements to Lord Oxford, was still in the process
of formation in September, 1729, and he was only "causing it to be
fairly written" in October, after his own Wycherley volume had passed
through the press. The false account is repeated in the preface to the
quarto, where we are told that the posthumous works of Wycherley were
printed the year after the copy of Pope's collection of letters had been
deposited in the library of Lord Oxford, which throws back the deposit
of the letters from the close of 1729 to 1727. Since the poet revived
and authenticated an anonymous fiction respecting his personal acts, he
may reasonably be supposed to have been the author of it. The object of
the imposition was to uphold the tale he had advanced in his Wycherley
volume. He had ceased to state openly that the publication was the act
of Lord Oxford; but he wished to have it believed that the letters were
in the keeping of his noble friend at the time, and to leave the
impression that the notion of printing them had not originated with
himself.</p></div>

letter is undated, and was published without any date by Curll. When
Pope reproduced it in the quarto of 1737, he dated it August, 1723; and
in the quarto of 1741 he changed the date to January, 1723, which must
be incorrect, since Bolingbroke was then abroad, and did not return to
England till June. Swift's reply is dated September 20, and as it was
between this period and June that the joint letter must have been
written, August is either the true date, or a close approximation to
it.</p></div>

"kept any copies of such stuff as I write," which would be decisive of
his custom at that early date, if much reliance could be placed on his
word. In 1716 he commenced correspondence with Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu, and afterwards published several of the letters among his
"Letters to Ladies." He was then at enmity with her, and as she retained
the originals, he must either have borrowed them prior to the quarrel
for the purpose of copying them, or else must have copied them before
they were sent. There is no direct evidence to show at what time he
commenced the practice of transcribing letters; but at the close of 1726
he began to compile the collection of 1735, and thenceforward he was
sure to let nothing escape which could contribute to his design.</p></div>

for the letter he had intended to send by him to Swift. Mr. Gerrard may
nevertheless have carried over the printed correspondence, which would
not have been openly entrusted to him by Pope, who professed to know
nothing about it. The poet may have thought upon reflection that it
would look less suspicious if his avowed letter and the anonymous parcel
were not transmitted by the same bearer.</p></div>

altogether a second volume of his works in prose."&mdash;"London Daily Post"
for March 24, 1741, quoted in the "Athen&aelig;um" for September 15, 1860. The
advertisement displays the same cautious phraseology as was employed in
the prefatory notice to the quarto, and speaks of the Dublin volume as
only printed, not published. One motive which probably induced Faulkner
to delay it was, that the work would have been incomplete without the
additional letters.</p></div>

the signature M., and the later page 89 has the signature N. The cause
of the difference is plain. It is the ordinary habit to begin the body
of a work on sheet B, and reserve the signature A, for the preliminary
matter. This is the method adopted with the three previous quarto
volumes of Pope's works, and was followed in the original quarto
impression of the correspondence; but after the poet had cancelled the
beginning of the volume, the sheet commonly marked B was in the second
state of the quarto marked A, which occasioned the usual sheet N to
become M. The discrepancy is an additional proof that the opening sheets
had been cancelled and reprinted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_152_167" id="Footnote_152_167"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152_167"><span class="label">[152]</span></a> There were probably minor cancels which did not disturb

aware that the work was not first published in Dublin. He therefore used
the evasive word "printed," and left it to his opponents to detect the
fallacy. The methods, however, by which Pope had obtained his priority
would not permit him to plead it, nor was he likely, by mooting the
question, to risk the revelation of his plot.</p></div>

"I know," Lord Mansfield observed, "that Mr. Pope had no paper upon
which the letters were written," which means that he had received this
assurance from Pope, and supposed it to be true. In one particular the
memory of Lord Mansfield deceived him. Blackstone on the authority of
the preface to the quarto of 1741, stated, while arguing the case of
Tonson <i>v.</i> Collins, that the letters "were published with the
connivance at least, if not under the direction of Swift," to which Lord
Mansfield replied, "Certainly not. Dr. Swift disclaimed it, and was
extremely angry." But this is opposed to the united evidence of Mrs.
Whiteway, Faulkner, and Pope, who all concur in testifying that Swift
consented to the publication.</p></div>

expected to prove mortal. Pope, in announcing his recovery to Swift on
October 15, added, "He goes abroad again, and is more cheerful than even
health can make a man." He meant that Arbuthnot was able to go about
again, which was still one of the commonest significations of the
phrase. Arbuthnot did not leave England, and from his letter to Swift on
October 17, it is clear that he had never entertained the design.</p></div>

circumstances, which are fatal to the conjecture, it is enough to say
that on September 10, 1726, Pope was unable to hold a pen, owing to the
injury he had received a day or two before when he was upset in
Bolingbroke's carriage. It was several weeks before he recovered the use
of his hand. In the case of Digby there is the additional difficulty
that as the nurse did not die till after September, 1725, so he himself
was dead before September, 1726.</p></div>

expressed by Spence, when he observed to Pope, "People have pitied you
extremely on reading your letters to Wycherley. Surely it was a very
difficult thing for you to keep well with him." "The most difficult
thing in the world," was Pope's reply. On another occasion he said to
Spence, "Wycherley was really angry with me for correcting his verses so
much. I was extremely plagued, up and down, for almost two years with
them. However it went off pretty well at last." When Pope tampered with
the written records which he cited as evidence upon the question, we can
place no reliance on his passing words.</p></div>

Warburton put forth a short pamphlet entitled, "A Letter to the Editor
of the Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism," &amp;c., which was reprinted,
in 1769, in the Appendix to Ruffhead's Life of Pope. In this reply
Warburton extenuates, without justifying, the act of his friend, and is
more successful in his attack upon Bolingbroke for exposing the
treachery than in his defence of Pope for perpetrating it. The "Letter
to the Editor of the Letters" is chiefly valuable for its admission of
the principal charges against the poet. His advocate, who had seen both
the genuine and corrupted edition of the phamphlet, allows that he had
tampered with the text. Bolingbroke had only specified alterations and
ommissions. Warburton goes further, and speaks of interpolations. In the
body of Ruffhead's work it is stated that Pope altered nothing, and
"only struck out some insults on the throne and the then reigning
monarch." But this is opposed to the language of Warburton twenty years
before, when the subject was fresh, and Bolingbroke was
living.&mdash;Ruffhead's Life of Pope, p. 526. Appendix, p. 573.</p></div>

<h2>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The clearness, the closeness, and the elegance of style with
which this preface is written, render it one of the best
pieces of prose in our language. It abounds in strong good
sense, and profound knowledge of life. It is written with
such simplicity that scarcely a single metaphor is to be
found in it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>This preface first appeared in the Works of Pope, 4to, 1717. The poet
submitted the manuscript to Atterbury, and the bishop thus replied in
December, 1716: "I return the preface, which I have read twice with
pleasure. The modesty and good sense there is in it, must please every
one that reads it. And since there is, as I said, nothing that can
offend, I see not why you should balance a moment about printing it,
always provided that there is nothing said there which you have occasion
to unsay hereafter, of which you yourself are the best, and the only
judge. This is my sincere opinion, which I give, because you ask it, and
which I would not give, though asked, but to a man I value as much as I
do you, being sensible how improper it is, on many accounts, for me to
interpose in things of this nature, which I never understood well, and
now understand somewhat less than ever I did." The suspicion which
Atterbury hinted to his friend, that some of the sentiments expressed in
the preface might hereafter be quoted against him, probably referred to
the vaunts in the concluding paragraphs. The poet paid no regard to the
warning, and lived to violate nearly all his professions. Johnson says
that the preface is "written with great sprightliness and elegance," but
the praise of Warton is hyperbolical when he terms it "one of the best
pieces of prose in our language." The style is often faulty, and never
rises to any extraordinary pitch of excellence; the "knowledge of life,"
which Warton calls "profound," is such as a little experience would
supply; and the "strong good sense" is interspersed with obvious
thoughts and erroneous maxims. The language of Atterbury is sober, and
even in writing to the author he was not betrayed by the partiality of
friendship into the exaggerations of Warton.</p>

<h2>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>I am inclined to think that both the writers of books, and the readers
of them, are generally not a little unreasonable in their expectations.
The first seem to fancy that the world must approve whatever they
produce, and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to please
them at any rate. Methinks, as on the one hand, no single man is born
with a right of controlling the opinions of all the rest; so on the
other, the world has no title to demand, that the whole care and time of
any particular person should be sacrificed to its entertainment.
Therefore I cannot but believe that writers and readers are under equal
obligations for as much fame, or pleasure, as each affords the other.</p>

<p>Every one acknowledges, it would be a wild notion to expect perfection
in any work of man: and yet one would think the contrary was taken for
granted, by the judgment commonly passed upon poems. A critic supposes
he has done his part if he proves a writer to have failed in an
expression, or erred in any particular point: and can it then be
wondered at if the poets in general seem resolved not to own themselves
in any error? For as long as one side will make no allowances, the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
will be brought to no acknowledgments.<a name="FNanchor_1_201" id="FNanchor_1_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_201" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I am afraid this extreme zeal on both sides is ill-placed; poetry and
criticism being by no means the universal concern of the world, but only
the affair of idle men who write in their closets, and of idle men who
read there. Yet sure, upon the whole, a bad author deserves better usage
than a bad critic: for a writer's endeavour, for the most part, is to
please his readers, and he fails merely through the misfortune of an ill
judgment; but such a critic's is to put them out of humour; a design he
could never go upon without both that and an ill temper.<a name="FNanchor_2_202" id="FNanchor_2_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_202" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>I think a good deal may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets.
What we call a genius, is hard to be distinguished by a man himself,
from a strong inclination: and if his genius be ever so great, he cannot
at first discover it any other way than by giving way to that prevalent
propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken. The only
method he has is to make the experiment by writing, and appealing to the
judgment of others. Now if he happens to write ill, which is certainly
no sin in itself, he is immediately made an object of ridicule. I wish
we had the humanity to reflect that even the worst authors might, in
their endeavour to please us, deserve something at our hands. We have no
cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting to
write; and this too may admit of alleviating circumstances. Their
particular friends may be either ignorant or insincere; and the rest of
the world in general is too well-bred to shock them with a truth, which
generally their booksellers are the first that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> inform them of. This
happens not till they have spent too much of their time to apply to any
profession which might better fit their talents; and till such talents
as they have are so far discredited as to be but of small service to
them. For, what is the hardest case imaginable, the reputation of a man
generally depends upon the first steps he makes in the world; and people
will establish their opinion of us, from what we do at that season when
we have least judgment to direct us.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a good poet no sooner communicates his works with the
same desire of information, but it is imagined he is a vain young
creature given up to the ambition of fame, when perhaps the poor man is
all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous. If he is made
to hope he may please the world, he falls under very unlucky
circumstances: for, from the moment he prints, he must expect to hear no
more truth than if he were a prince or a beauty. If he has not very good
sense (and indeed there are twenty men of wit for one man of sense) his
living thus in a course of flattery may put him in no small danger of
becoming a coxcomb: if he has, he will consequently have so much
diffidence as not to reap any great satisfaction from his praise: since,
if it be given to his face, it can scarce be distinguished from
flattery, and if in his absence, it is hard to be certain of it. Were he
sure to be commended by the best and most knowing, he is as sure of
being envied by the worst and most ignorant, which are the majority;<a name="FNanchor_3_203" id="FNanchor_3_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_203" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
for it is with a fine genius as with a fine fashion, all those are
displeased at it who are not able to follow it: and it is to be feared
that esteem will seldom do any man so much good, as ill-will does him
harm. Then there is a third class of people, who make the largest part
of mankind,&mdash;those of ordinary or indifferent capacities&mdash;; and these,
to a man, will hate or suspect him: a hundred honest gentlemen will
dread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> him as a wit, and a hundred innocent women as a satirist. In a
word, whatever be his fate in poetry, it is ten to one but he must give
up all the reasonable aims of life for it. There are indeed some
advantages accruing from a genius to poetry, and they are all I can
think of,&mdash;the agreeable power of self-amusement when a man is idle or
alone; the privilege of being admitted into the best company; and the
freedom of saying as many careless things as other people, without being
so severely remarked upon.<a name="FNanchor_4_204" id="FNanchor_4_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_204" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_5_205" id="FNanchor_5_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_205" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>I believe if any one, early in his life, should contemplate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> the
dangerous fate of authors, he would scarce be of their number on any
consideration. The life of a wit is a warfare upon earth; and the
present spirit of the learned world is such, that to attempt to serve it
any way one must have the constancy of a martyr, and a resolution to
suffer for its sake. 'I could wish people would believe, what I am
pretty certain they will not, that I have been much less concerned about
fame than I durst declare till this occasion, when methinks I should
find more credit than I could heretofore: since my writings have had
their fate already, and it is too late to think of prepossessing the
reader in their favour. I would plead it as some merit in me, that the
world has never been prepared for these trifles by prefaces,<a name="FNanchor_6_206" id="FNanchor_6_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_206" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> biassed
by recommendations, dazzled with the names of great patrons,<a name="FNanchor_7_207" id="FNanchor_7_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_207" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> wheedled
with fine reasons and pretences, or troubled with excuses.'<a name="FNanchor_8_208" id="FNanchor_8_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_208" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I confess
it was want of consideration that made me an author; I writ because it
amused me; I corrected because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to
write; and I published because I was told I might please such as it was
a credit to please. To what degree I have done this, I am really
ignorant. I had too much fondness for my productions to judge of them at
first, and too much judgment to be pleased with them at last. But I have
reason to think they can have no reputation which will continue long, or
which deserves to do so:<a name="FNanchor_9_209" id="FNanchor_9_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_209" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> for they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> always fallen short not only
of what I read of others, but even of my own ideas of poetry.</p>

<p>If any one should imagine I am not in earnest, I desire him to reflect,
that the ancients, to say the least of them, had as much genius as we;
and that to take more pains, and employ more time, cannot fail to
produce more complete pieces. They constantly applied themselves not
only to that art, but to that single branch of an art, to which their
talent was most powerfully bent; and it was the business of their lives
to correct and finish their works for posterity.<a name="FNanchor_10_210" id="FNanchor_10_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_210" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> If we can pretend
to have used the same industry, let us expect the same immortality:
though, if we took the same care, we should still lie under a further
misfortune: they writ in languages that became universal and
everlasting, while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in
duration. A mighty foundation for our pride! when the utmost we can
hope,<a name="FNanchor_11_211" id="FNanchor_11_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_211" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is but to be read in one island, and to be thrown aside at the
end of one age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>All that is left us is to recommend our productions by the imitation of
the ancients;<a name="FNanchor_12_212" id="FNanchor_12_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_212" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and it will be found true, that in every age, the
highest character for sense and learning has been obtained by those who
have been most indebted to them. For, to say truth, whatever is very
good sense, must have been common sense in all times; and what we call
learning, is but the knowledge of the sense of our predecessors.
Therefore they who say our thoughts are not our own, because they
resemble the ancients, may as well say our faces are not our own,
because they are like our fathers: and, indeed, it is very unreasonable
that people should expect us to be scholars, and yet be angry to find us
so.<a name="FNanchor_13_213" id="FNanchor_13_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_213" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>I fairly confess that I have served myself all I could by reading; that
I made use of the judgment of authors dead and living; that I omitted no
means in my power to be informed of my errors, both by my friends and
enemies:<a name="FNanchor_14_214" id="FNanchor_14_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_214" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but the true reason these pieces are not more correct, is
owing to the consideration how short a time they, and I, have to
live.<a name="FNanchor_15_215" id="FNanchor_15_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_215" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> One may be ashamed to consume half one's days in bringing
sense and rhyme together: and what critic can be so unreasonable, as not
to leave a man time enough for any more serious employment, or more
agreeable amusement?</p>

<p>The only plea I shall use for the favour of the public, is, that I have
as great a respect for it as most authors have for themselves; and that
I have sacrificed much of my own self-love for its sake, in preventing
not only many mean things from seeing the light, but many which I
thought tolerable. 'I would not be like those authors, who forgive
themselves some particular lines for the sake of a whole poem, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i> a whole poem for the sake of some particular lines.'<a name="FNanchor_16_216" id="FNanchor_16_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_216" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I
believe no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer as the
power of rejecting his own thoughts; and it must be this, if any thing,
that can give me a chance to be one. For what I have published I can
only hope to be pardoned; but for what I have burned I deserve to be
praised. On this account the world is under some obligation to me, and
owes me the justice in return to look upon no verses as mine that are
not inserted in this collection.<a name="FNanchor_17_217" id="FNanchor_17_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_217" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> And perhaps nothing could make it
worth my while to own what are really so, but to avoid the imputation of
so many dull and immoral things, as partly by malice, and partly by
ignorance, have been ascribed to me. I must further acquit myself of the
presumption of having lent my name to recommend any Miscellanies,<a name="FNanchor_18_218" id="FNanchor_18_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_218" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
or works of other men;<a name="FNanchor_19_219" id="FNanchor_19_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_219" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> a thing I never thought becoming a person who
has hardly credit enough to answer for his own.</p>

<p>In this office of collecting my pieces, I am altogether uncertain
whether to look upon myself as a man building a monument,<a name="FNanchor_20_220" id="FNanchor_20_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_220" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or burying
the dead. If time shall make it the former, may these poems, as long as
they last, remain as a testimony, that their author never made his
talents subservient to the mean and unworthy ends of party or
self-interest; the gratification of public prejudices or private
passions; the flattery of the undeserving, or the insult of the
unfortunate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> If I have written well, let it be considered that it is
what no man can do without good sense, a quality that not only renders
one capable of being a good writer, but a good man. And if I have made
any acquisition in the opinion of any one under the notion of the
former, let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the
latter.<a name="FNanchor_21_221" id="FNanchor_21_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_221" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>But if this publication be only a more solemn funeral of my remains, I
desire it may be known that I die in charity, and in my senses, without
any murmurs against the justice of this age, or any mad appeals to
posterity. I declare I shall think the world in the right, and quietly
submit to every truth which time shall discover to the prejudice of
these writings; not so much as wishing so irrational a thing as that
every body should be deceived merely for my credit. However, I desire it
may then be considered, that there are very few things in this
collection which were not written under the age of five-and-twenty, so
that my youth may be made, as it never fails to be in executions, a case
of compassion; that I was never so concerned about my works as to
vindicate them in print, believing if any thing was good it would defend
itself, and what was bad could never be defended; that I used no
artifice to raise or continue a reputation, depreciated no dead author I
was obliged to, bribed no living one with unjust praise, insulted no
adversary with ill language,<a name="FNanchor_22_222" id="FNanchor_22_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_222" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> or, when I could not attack a rival's
works, encouraged reports against his morals. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> conclude, if this
volume perish, let it serve as a warning to the critics not to take too
much pains for the future to destroy such things as will die of
themselves; and a <i>memento mori</i> to some of my vain contemporaries the
poets, to teach them that when real merit is wanting, it avails nothing
to have been encouraged by the great, commended by the eminent, and
favoured by the public in general.<a name="FNanchor_23_223" id="FNanchor_23_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_223" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_201" id="Footnote_1_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_201"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In all editions till that of Warburton it was thus: "For as
long as one side despises a well meant endeavour, the other will not be
satisfied with a moderate approbation." The first sentence of the next
paragraph is expanded in the manuscript: "Indeed they both proceed in
such a manner as if they really believed that poetry was immediate
inspiration. It were to be wished they would reflect that this
extraordinary zeal and fury is ill placed, poetry and criticism being by
no means the universal concern of the world. I do not say this to
imitate those people who make a merit of undervaluing the arts and
qualifications without which they had never been taken notice of. I
think poetry as useful as any other art, because it is as entertaining,
and therefore as well deserving of mankind."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_202" id="Footnote_2_202"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_202"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Until the edition of Warburton the reading was slightly
different: "Yet sure upon the whole a bad author deserves better usage
than a bad critic; a man may be the former merely through the misfortune
of an ill judgment, but he cannot be the latter without both that and an
ill temper."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_203" id="Footnote_3_203"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_203"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The instance of Pope himself is a refutation of his theory
that the world was almost exclusively composed of flatterers and
detractors, and chiefly of the last. Where he could count the deniers of
his genius by tens he could number his admirers by thousands.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_204" id="Footnote_4_204"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_204"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> What is here said of the privileges of the poetic character
will not, I believe, bear the test of truth and experience. Surely a
poet is not particularly allowed "the freedom of saying careless
things," and his moral character and manners are to be estimated, as
well as his talents, before he is entitled to a certain station in
society.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_205" id="Footnote_5_205"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_205"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In the MS. it followed thus: "For my part, I confess, had I
seen things in this view at first, the public had never been troubled
either with my writings, or with this apology for them. I am sensible
how difficult it is to speak of one's self with decency: but when a man
must speak of himself, the best way is to speak truth of himself, or, he
may depend upon it, others will do it for him. I will therefore make
this preface a general confession of all my thoughts of my own poetry,
resolving with the same freedom to expose myself, as it is in the power
of any other to expose them. In the first place, I thank God and nature
that I was born with a love to poetry; for nothing more conduces to fill
up all the intervals of our time, or, if rightly used, to make the whole
course of life entertaining: <i>Cantantes licet usque (minus via l&aelig;det).</i>
It is a vast happiness to possess the pleasures of the head, the only
pleasures in which a man is sufficient to himself, and the only part of
him which, to his satisfaction, he can employ all day long. The muses
are <i>amic&aelig; omnium horarum</i>; and, like our gay acquaintance, the best
company in the world as long as one expects no real service from them. I
confess there was a time when I was in love with myself, and my first
productions were the children of self-love upon innocence. I had made an
epic poem, and panegyrics on all the princes in Europe, and thought
myself the greatest genius that ever was. I cannot but regret those
delightful visions of my childhood, which, like the fine colours we see
when our eyes are shut, are vanished for ever. Many trials and sad
experience have so undeceived me by degrees, that I am utterly at a loss
at what rate to value myself. As for fame, I shall be glad of any I can
get, and not repine at any I miss; and as for vanity, I have enough to
keep me from hanging myself, or even from wishing those hanged who would
take it away. It was this that made me write. The sense of my faults
made me correct: besides that it was as pleasant to me to correct as to
write."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton.</span>
</p><p>
Spence relates that Pope said to Mr. Saville: "If I was to begin the
world again, and knew just what I do now, I would never write a verse."
In the passage from his manuscript preface, he intimates that he would
have amused himself by writing poetry, but would have forborne to
publish what he wrote. Either he was not honest in the opinion, or he
was self-deceived. He valued his fame above all things, and left no
means untried to protect and promote it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_206" id="Footnote_6_206"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_206"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> As was the practice of his master Dryden, who is severely
lashed for this in the Tale of a Tub.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_207" id="Footnote_7_207"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_207"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Pope was not justified in his boast. He dropped the
practice of fulsome dedications, but he made the most of his
distinguished friends in the body of his pieces, and though no "names of
great patrons" are given in this preface, he could not abstain from
announcing in the final sentence how much they had countenanced him.
This, moreover, was to proclaim the "recommendations" he repudiated, and
in every issue of his works the preface, which contained the
inconsistency, was followed in addition by a series of Recommendatory
Poems.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_208" id="Footnote_8_208"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_208"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The passage in inverted commas was first added in 1736.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_209" id="Footnote_9_209"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_209"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> One of Pope's favourite topics is contempt for his own
poetry. For this, if it had been real, he would deserve no commendation;
and in this he was certainly not sincere, for his value of himself was
sufficiently observed; and of what could he be proud but of his poetry?
He writes, he says, when "he has just nothing else to do;" yet Swift
complains that he was never at leisure for conversation, because he "had
always some poetical scheme in his head." It was punctually required
that his writing-box should be set upon his bed before he rose; and Lord
Oxford's domestic related that in the dreadful winter of 1740, she was
called from her bed by him four times in one night to supply him with
paper lest he should lose a thought.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_210" id="Footnote_10_210"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_210"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> For the next sentence the manuscript has this passage:
"But I fear it is far otherwise with modern poets. We must bring our wit
to the press, as gardeners do their flowers to the market, which if they
cannot vend in the morning are sure to die before night. Were we
animated by the same noble ambition, and ready to prosecute it with
equal ardour, our languages are not only confined to a narrow extent of
country, but are in a perpetual flux, not so much as fixed by an
acknowledged grammar, while theirs were such as time and fate conspired
to make universal and everlasting."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_211" id="Footnote_11_211"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_211"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> In place of the remainder of the sentence he had written
in the manuscript, "is but to live twenty years longer than Quarles, or
Withers, or Dennis." The doctrine of Pope was unworthy the countryman of
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton. The first three had not been
"thrown aside at the end of one age," and no one who was capable of
comprehending the last could seriously believe that his reputation would
be ephemeral. The hypothesis, that the writers in a dead tongue can
alone secure a worthy audience, is altogether chimerical. The literature
of living languages has the ascendancy, and Shakespeare is more read,
and better appreciated, than &AElig;schylus and Sophocles.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_212" id="Footnote_12_212"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_212"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> I have frequently heard Dr. Young speak with great
disapprobation of the doctrine contained in this passage, with a view to
which he wrote his discourse on Original Composition.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
The assertion of Pope is in the face of the facts. All the greatest
names in modern literature have a marked originality, and those authors
who have imitated the ancients, except in subordinate circumstances,
have usually produced tame and lifeless compositions, which were
speedily forgotten.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_213" id="Footnote_13_213"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_213"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The sophistry is transparent. A man may be a scholar
without being a plagiarist or an imitator.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_214" id="Footnote_14_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_214"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Here followed in the first edition, "and that I expect not
to be excused in any negligence on account of youth, want of leisure, or
any other idle allegations." This was inconsistent with his request, at
the conclusion of his preface, that those who condemned his poems would
remember his youth when he composed them. After the omitted sentence he
had added in the manuscript, "I have ever been fearful of making an ill
present to the world, for which I have as much respect as most poets
have for themselves. What I thought incorrect I suppressed; and what I
thought most finished I never published but with fear and trembling."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_215" id="Footnote_15_215"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_215"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> From hence to the end of the paragraph the manuscript
continues thus: "A man that can expect but sixty years may be ashamed to
employ thirty in measuring syllables, and bringing sense and rhyme
together. We spend our youth in the pursuit of riches or fame in hopes
to enjoy them when we are old, and when we are old we find it is too
late to enjoy anything. I have got over the mistake pretty early. I
therefore hope the wits will pardon me if I leave myself time enough to
save my soul, and some wise men will be of my opinion even if I should
think a part of it better spent in the enjoyment of life than in
pleasing the critics."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_216" id="Footnote_16_216"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_216"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This sentence was in the manuscript, but Pope omitted it
in the edition of 1717, and restored it in 1736.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_217" id="Footnote_17_217"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_217"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> In the manuscript he added, "which indeed was my chief
view in making it, for in the present liberty of the press, a man is
forced to appear as bad as he is, not to be thought worse." The
assertion is qualified in the text, but he could not entirely abandon
the affectation of pretending that he collected his works to escape the
disgrace of the pieces which were falsely attributed to him, and not to
obtain credit from his own performances.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_218" id="Footnote_18_218"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_218"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> "I am always highly delighted," said Addison in the
Spectator, No. 523, Oct. 30, 1712, "with the discovery of any rising
genius among my countrymen. For this reason I have read over, with great
pleasure, the late Miscellany published by Mr. Pope, in which there are
many excellent compositions of that ingenious gentleman." The
announcement referred to the first edition of Lintot's Miscellany, and
from the literary intercourse which existed between Addison, Steele, and
Pope at the time, the compilation was not likely to have been ascribed
to the latter in the Spectator without sufficient authority. The
language of Pope seems carefully selected to avoid the direct denial
that he was the editor. The work was published anonymously, and he only
asserts that he had "never lent his <i>name</i> to recommend any
miscellanies." The disclaimer was probably directed against the device
adopted by Lintot in the second edition, 1 vol. 8vo, 1714, which bore
this title, "Miscellaneous Poems and Translations. By several hands.
Particularly, etc." Here followed a list of Pope's contributions, and
his alone. Underneath the list a line was drawn across the page, and
below this line was printed in capital letters, "By Mr. Pope." The
complete separation between the list of pieces and the name of the poet
disconnected them to the eye, and left the impression that Pope was the
editor of the entire work. The same plan was continued till the fifth
edition, 2 vols. 12mo, 1727, when Lintot grew bolder, and inserted
bastard title-pages with the words, "Mr. Pope's Miscellany." The poet,
who corrected the proofs of his own pieces for the fifth edition,
assured Christopher Pitt, in a letter of July 23, 1726, that he had
never had anything to do with the remainder of the work; but the private
assurance, after many years, of a man who had no regard for truth does
not outweigh the assertion in the Spectator, when coupled with the
peculiar wording by which he evaded the public contradiction of the
statement.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_219" id="Footnote_19_219"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_219"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> In 1721 he broke through his rule by recommending the
poems of Parnell to Lord Oxford in an Epistle in verse.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cunningham.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_220" id="Footnote_20_220"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_220"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> A few sentences before he had said, "for what I have
published I can only hope to be pardoned," and already he has forgotten
his mock modesty, and admits he has a hope that his works may prove "a
monument."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_221" id="Footnote_21_221"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_221"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The commendation of his own goodness is a theme which
constantly recurs in Pope, as if he hoped to conceal his delinquencies
by his loud profession of the contrary qualities. The topic is
introduced into this preface in a forced manner, and treated with
singular weakness. Intellectual capacity and literary pre-eminence are
no security for moral excellence; and it was idle to ask the public to
forget his reputation as a poet, which was his sole claim to fame, and
to commemorate him for virtues of which the world had no proof, and
which, if they were real, he shared with thousands.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_222" id="Footnote_22_222"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_222"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> This was written in 1716; did our author recollect this
sentiment in 1729[8]?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
Warton alludes to the Dunciad, but to have "insulted adversaries with
ill language" was only one out of several particulars, in which Pope's
subsequent career belied the protestations in his preface.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_223" id="Footnote_23_223"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_223"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> This far-fetched excuse of Pope for rebuking the vanity of
contemporary poets, was a clumsy expedient to gratify his own vanity in
proclaiming to the world that "he had been encouraged by the great, and
commended by the eminent." He had not much title to reprove the vanity
of his brethren, when, in the same sentence, he recorded the praise
which the different orders of mankind had bestowed upon himself.</p></div>

<h2>PREFACE TO POPE'S WORKS.</h2>

<h3>VOL. II. 4<span class="smcap">to</span>, 1735.</h3>

<h3>THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.</h3>


<p>All I had to say of my writings is contained in my preface to the first
of these volumes, printed for J. Tonson, and B. Lintot in quarto and
folio in the year 1717; and all I have to say of myself will be found in
my last Epistle.<a name="FNanchor_1_224" id="FNanchor_1_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_224" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I have nothing to add, but that this volume, and the
above-mentioned contain whatsoever I have written, and<a name="FNanchor_2_225" id="FNanchor_2_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_225" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> designed for
the press, except my translation of the Iliad (with my preface and
notes), of twelve books of the Odyssey, with the postscript (not the
notes), the preface to Shakespeare, and a few Spectators<a name="FNanchor_3_226" id="FNanchor_3_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_226" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
Guardians. Whatever besides I have written, or joined in writing with
Dr. Swift, Dr. Arbuthnot, or Mr. Gay (the only persons with whom I ever
wrote in conjunction) are to be found in the four volumes of
Miscellanies by us published.<a name="FNanchor_4_227" id="FNanchor_4_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_227" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> I think them too inconsiderable to be
separated and reprinted here; nevertheless, that none of my faults may
be imputed to another, I must own that of the prose part, the Thoughts
on Various Subjects at the end of the second volume, were wholly mine;
and of the verses, the Happy Life of a Country Parson, the Alley in
imitation of Spenser, the characters of Macer, Artimesia, and Phryne,
the Verses to Mrs. M[artha] B[lount] on her Birth-day, and a few
epigrams.<a name="FNanchor_5_228" id="FNanchor_5_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_228" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It will be but justice to me to believe that nothing more
is mine, notwithstanding all that has been published in my name, or
added to my<a name="FNanchor_6_229" id="FNanchor_6_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_229" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> miscellanies since 1717,<a name="FNanchor_7_230" id="FNanchor_7_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_230" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> by any bookseller whatsoever.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_224" id="Footnote_1_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_224"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In the reprint of this preface in 1740, Pope added the
words, "to Dr. Arbuthnot."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_225" id="Footnote_2_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_225"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In the octavo of 1735, Pope omitted the words "written,
and." In 1740 he again inserted them, and omitted the words, "and
designed for the press."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_226" id="Footnote_3_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_226"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The Messiah was first published in the Spectator, but as it
was also inserted in the quarto of 1717, the poet cannot have included
it among the pieces which were not contained in either the first or
second volume of his works. His only other known contribution to the
Spectator was a short letter in No. 532, Nov. 10, 1712, on the verses
which the Emperor Hadrian spoke when he was dying. The "few Spectators"
to which Pope referred have not been identified, and since he never
reproduced, or particularised them, it may be taken for granted that
they were of slight importance.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_227" id="Footnote_4_227"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_227"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In the edition of 1740 Pope affixed to this sentence the
clause, "or make part of the Memoirs of Scriblerus, not yet printed."
His enumeration of the Scriblerus among his genuine productions was
doubtless the consequence of his resolution to publish it, and it
accordingly appeared in 1741 in the second volume of his prose works.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_228" id="Footnote_5_228"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_228"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The passage from "I think" down to "epigrams," was left out
in 1740, for Pope soon admitted into his collected works those pieces in
the Miscellanies which he here said were "too inconsiderable to be
reprinted."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_229" id="Footnote_6_229"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_229"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> "Any" in the edition of 1740.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_230" id="Footnote_7_230"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_230"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> He omitted "1717" in 1740. His insinuation that none of the
other pieces ascribed to him were genuine, is in his ordinary style of
equivocation, and is now known to be erroneous.</p></div>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_231" id="Footnote_1_231"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_231"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The Recommendatory poems addressed to Pope are without
exception dull, insipid productions, which never rise above mediocrity,
and sometimes fall below it. Only those are reprinted here which he
himself prefixed to his works. The first seven appeared in the quarto of
1717, and the remaining two in the octavo of 1736.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_232" id="Footnote_2_232"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_232"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Legally speaking, of Buckingham<i>shire</i>; for he would not
take the title of Buckingham, under a fear that there was lurking
somewhere or other a claim to that title amongst the connections of the
Villiers family. He was a pompous grandee, who lived in uneasy
splendour, and, as a writer, most extravagantly overrated: accordingly,
he is now forgotten. Such was his vanity, and his ridiculous mania for
allying himself with royalty, that he first of all had the presumption
to court the Princess (afterwards Queen) Anne. Being rejected, he then
offered himself to the illegitimate daughter of James II. by the
daughter of Sir Charles Sedley. She was as ostentatious as himself, and
accepted him.&mdash;<span class="smcap">De Quincey.</span>
</p><p>
Pope commenced the interchange of praise with the Duke of Buckingham by
celebrating him in the Essay on Criticism. The return verses of the Duke
are little better than drivelling. His Essay on Satire and Essay on
Poetry are his principal works, but though one was retouched by Dryden
and the other by Pope, they are very second-rate performances. The Duke
died in February, 1721, aged 72.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_233" id="Footnote_3_233"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_233"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Anne, wife of Heneage, fifth Earl of Winchelsea, and
daughter of Sir William Kingsmill. She died on Aug. 5, 1720.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Croker.</span>
</p><p>
She wrote a tragedy called Aristomenes, or the Royal Shepherd, to which
Pope may be supposed to allude in his letter to Caryll of Dec. 15, 1713,
where he says, "I was invited to dinner to my Lady Winchelsea, and after
dinner to hear a play read, at both which I sat in great disorder with
sickness at my head and stomach." Pope omitted her rugged, bald, prosaic
verses in 1736, probably because they were intrinsically worthless, and
because the name of the author had ceased to carry any weight. In 1727
and 1732 they were printed with Pope's poems in Lintot's Miscellany, and
doubtless with the sanction of Pope himself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_234" id="Footnote_4_234"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_234"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> These verses, with the heading, "To my friend Mr. Pope, on
his Pastorals," originally appeared in 1709, in the same volume of
Tonson's Miscellany which contained the Pastorals themselves. In the
fifth edition of Lintot's Miscellany, 1727, and in the sixth edition,
1732, the poem of Wycherley, who was then dead, is prefixed to Pope's
pieces, and bears the title, "To Mr. Pope at sixteen years old, on
occasion of his Pastorals." This was untrue, and seems designed to
convey a false idea of Pope's precocity. The lines were not addressed to
him till he was twenty, as appears from Wycherley's letter of May 18,
1708, in which he says, "I have made a compliment in verse upon the
printing your Pastorals which you shall see when you see me." Dennis,
and others, accused Pope of being the author of the flattering tribute.
The poet appealed in refutation of the charge to Wycherley's letters,
and added that the first draught, and corrected copy of the panegyric,
which were still extant in the Harley library in Wycherley's
handwriting, would show "that if they received any alteration from Mr.
Pope it was in the omission of some of his own praises." Documents to
which nobody had access proved nothing. Mr. Croker considered that there
was strong internal evidence from the smoothness of the rhythm, the
antithetical style, and the nature of the commendation, that Pope must
have assisted in reducing the lines to their present shape. The
mannerism of both authors can be clearly traced in them. They have the
stamp of Wycherley, improved by Pope.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_235" id="Footnote_5_235"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_235"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> If Wycherley had been capable of anything of the kind,
this, and the previous couplet, might have been written after the Essay
on Criticism, but surely could not have been inspired by a perusal of
the manuscript of the Pastorals.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Croker.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_236" id="Footnote_6_236"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_236"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This line was omitted by Pope in 1736.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_238" id="Footnote_8_238"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_238"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> This triplet was omitted by Pope in the edition of 1736.</p></div>

St. John's College, Oxford, and afterwards demy of Magdalen
College.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cunningham.</span>
</p><p>
He graduated M.A. April 30, 1695, and as he could hardly have been an
M.A. before he was twenty-five, he would have been forty-five at the
date of these verses. There is a rhyming "Epistle to Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, by Mr.
Fr. Knapp, of Magdalen College, in Oxford," in Tonson's Fourth
Miscellany.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Croker.</span>
</p><p>
He died in, or before 1727; for in one of Lintot's advertisements of
that year he is described as the "<i>late</i> Rev. Mr. Francis Knapp, Dean of
Killala."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_240" id="Footnote_10_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_240"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> There are several lines in this copy of verses, which
could not be endured in a common magazine. So much is the public ear,
and public taste improved.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_241" id="Footnote_11_241"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_241"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The next six lines were left out by Pope in 1736.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_242" id="Footnote_12_242"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_242"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Hough was chosen president of Magdalen College in April,
1687, in defiance of the mandate sent by James II. to the fellows,
requiring them to elect Farmer, a profligate and a papist. The illegal
proceedings of the king in dispossessing the protestants, and filling
the college with romanists, alarmed and enraged the country, and
contributed largely to the Revolution of 1688. In May, 1690, Hough
became Bishop of Oxford. He was translated to Lichfield and Coventry in
1699, and to Worcester in 1717, where he remained till his death in May,
1743, at the age of ninety-three.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_243" id="Footnote_13_243"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_243"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> By far the most elegant, and best turned compliment of all
addressed to our author, happily borrowed from a fine Greek epigram, and
most gracefully applied.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
There is little merit in borrowing a compliment from the Anthology, and
the felicity of its application in the present instance may be
questioned, notwithstanding the emphatic praise of Warton. The
mythological basis of the lines, which is appropriate in the Greek,
becomes childish when adopted by an English poet, and the point of the
piece, which turns upon the assumption that Pope's translation was
vastly superior to the original, is too extravagant to be pleasing.
Fenton was a scholar, and could not have thought what he said.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_244" id="Footnote_14_244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_244"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> "I would add," says Dr. Johnson, in his Life of Parnell,
"that the description of barrenness in his verses to Pope was borrowed
from Secundus, but lately searching for the passage, which I had
formerly read, I could not find it." The borrowed description is the
only tolerable part of the poem, which is in a clumsy strain, unlike the
usual easy style of Parnell.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_245" id="Footnote_15_245"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_245"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> He was only son to the Lord Chancellor Harcourt, and died
in 1720.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Roscoe.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_246" id="Footnote_16_246"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_246"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> It was paying pitiful homage to rank to call an
indifferent versifier, like the Duke of Buckingham, "great Sheffield,"
and pretend that he was the instructor and model of Pope.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_247" id="Footnote_17_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_247"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The comparison of the three Graces, admiring the
reflection of themselves in Pope's works, to Narcissus enamoured of his
own face in the stream, is a ludicrous conceit, and the execution is on
a par with the idea.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_248" id="Footnote_18_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_248"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> This paragraph refers to Pope's Temple of Fame.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_249" id="Footnote_19_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_249"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Pope's genius was not epic, and the only epic poem he
composed was his juvenile effort, Alcander, which he burnt because it
was too worthless to be preserved.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_250" id="Footnote_20_250"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_250"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> This and the concluding verse are from the Temple of
Fame.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_251" id="Footnote_21_251"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_251"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> These lines first appeared in 1726, in the translation of
the Odyssey, where they were appended by Broome to the final note. Pope
inserted them in the 8vo edition of his works in 1736.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_252" id="Footnote_22_252"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_252"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> This was a compliment our author could not take much
pleasure in reading; for he could not value himself on his edition of
Shakespeare.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_253" id="Footnote_23_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_253"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The comparison on both sides is wanting in truth. The
superficial researches, and meagre notes of Pope did not renovate
Shakespeare, and no second Raphael has repainted the pictures of Raphael
the first. Fitness of praise was a merit which the writers of
commendatory verses commonly despised. Their study was to outvie each
other in the grossness, and insincerity of their flattery.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_254" id="Footnote_24_254"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_254"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Odyssey, lib. xvi.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Broome.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_255" id="Footnote_25_255"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_255"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Pope inserted this tribute among the Recommendatory poems
prefixed to the 8vo edition of his works, 1736. Lyttelton was not raised
to the peerage till November, 1757, twenty-seven years after the date of
his verses.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_256" id="Footnote_26_256"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_256"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Warton prefers Fenton's verses, but in my opinion these
lines of Lord Lyttelton's are much superior to all the other
recommendatory verses. They are as elegant and correct in themselves, as
the sentiments they convey appear sincere, and worthy an ingenuous,
cultivated, and liberal mind. There is a small inaccuracy in one or two
expressions, and perhaps it would have been better if Virgil's speech,
which forms the conclusion, had been compressed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>The following Translations were selected from many others done by the
author in his youth; for the most part indeed but a sort of exercises,
while he was improving himself in the languages, and carried by his
early bent to poetry to perform them rather in verse than prose. Mr.
Dryden's Fables came out about that time,<a name="FNanchor_1_257" id="FNanchor_1_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_257" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which occasioned the
translations from Chaucer. They were first separately printed in
Miscellanies by J. Tonson and B. Lintot, and afterwards collected in the
quarto edition of 1717. The Imitations of English Authors, which are
added at the end, were done as early; some of them at fourteen or
fifteen years old; but having also got into Miscellanies, we have put
them here together to complete this juvenile volume.<a name="FNanchor_2_258" id="FNanchor_2_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_258" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_258" id="Footnote_2_258"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_258"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This advertisement was first prefixed by Pope to vol. iii.

Temple of Fame, Sappho to Phaon, Vertumnus and Pomona, The Fable of
Dryope, The first book of Statius's Thebais, January and May, The Wife
of Bath's Prologue, and the Imitations of English Poets. Pope apologises
for printing the Imitations by saying that they had got into
Miscellanies, which is an insinuation that the pieces had found their
way to the press without his consent. It was he himself who published
them. They are inserted in the present edition among the minor poems.</p></div>

<p>It was in his childhood only that Pope could make choice of so
injudicious a writer as Statius to translate. It were to be wished that
no youth of genius were suffered ever to look into Statius, Lucan,
Claudian, or Seneca the tragedian,&mdash;authors who, by their forced
conceits, by their violent metaphors, by their swelling epithets, by
their want of a just decorum, have a strong tendency to dazzle, and to
mislead inexperienced minds, and tastes unformed, from the true relish
of possibility, propriety, simplicity, and nature. Statius had
undoubtedly invention, ability, and spirit; but his images are gigantic
and outrageous, and his sentiments tortured and hyperbolical. One cannot
forbear reflecting on the short duration of a true taste in poetry among
the Romans. From the time of Lucretius to that of Statius was no more
than about one hundred and forty-seven years; and if I might venture to
pronounce so rigorous a sentence, I would say, that the Romans can boast
of but eight poets who are unexceptionably excellent,&mdash;namely, Terence,
Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Propertius, Ph&aelig;drus.
These only can be called legitimate models of just thinking and writing.
Succeeding authors, as it happens in all countries, resolving to be
original and new, and to avoid the imputation of copying, become
distorted and unnatural. By endeavouring to open an unbeaten path, they
deserted simplicity and truth; weary of common and obvious beauties,
they must needs hunt for remote and artificial decorations.</p>

<p>It is plain that Pope was not blind to the faults of Statius, many of
which he points out with judgment and truth, in a letter to Mr.
Cromwell, written in 1708[9]. After this censure of Statius's manner, it
is but justice to add, that in the Thebais there are many strokes of a
strong imagination; and, indeed, the picture of Amphiaraus, swallowed up
suddenly by a chasm that opened in the ground, is truly
sublime.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></span></p>

<p>Statius was a favourite writer with the poets of the middle ages. His
bloated magnificence of description, gigantic images, and pompous
diction suited their taste, and were somewhat of a piece with the
romances they so much admired. They neglected the gentler and genuine
graces of Virgil, which they could not relish. His pictures were too
correctly and chastely drawn to take their fancies; and truth of design,
elegance of expression, and the arts of composition, were not their
object.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Warton.</span></p>

<p>In this translation there are some excellent passages, particularly
those pointed out by Dr. Warton&mdash;"O father Ph&oelig;bus," v. 829, and the
exquisite lines descriptive of evening, "'Twas now the time," &amp;c., 474;
but some of the most striking images are omitted, some added, and some
misunderstood. Let us however confess, that the versification is truly
wonderful, considering the age of the author. It would be endless to
point out more particularly occasional errors and inaccuracies, in a
composition which can be considered no otherwise than as an
extraordinary specimen of versification, before the writer's judgment
and taste were matured.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>According to the information which Pope gave to Spence, he commenced an
epic poem at thirteen, and wrote four books of about a thousand verses
each.<a name="FNanchor_2_260" id="FNanchor_2_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_260" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As his taste and judgment improved, he discovered the crudeness
of his early flights, and for a while he almost relinquished his
attempts at original composition, "My first taking to imitating," he
said, "was not out of vanity, but humility. I saw how defective my own
things were; and I endeavoured to mend my manner by copying good strokes
from others."<a name="FNanchor_3_261" id="FNanchor_3_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_261" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "In my rambles through the poets," he said again, "when
I met with a passage or story that pleased me more than ordinary, I used
to endeavour to imitate it, or translate it into English; and this gave
rise to my imitations published so long after."<a name="FNanchor_4_262" id="FNanchor_4_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_262" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In speaking of Pope's
youthful efforts, Spence uses the word "imitation" as synonymous with
"translation." "Some of his first exercises," he says, "were
<i>imitations</i> of the stories that pleased him most in Ovid, or any other
poet that he was reading. I have one of these original exercises now by
me in his own hand. It is the story of Acis and Galatea, from Ovid; and
was <i>translated</i> when he was but fourteen years old."<a name="FNanchor_5_263" id="FNanchor_5_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_263" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Pope appears to
have sometimes employed the term imitation with the same latitude, and
probably meant by it that he endeavoured to imitate, in the English turn
of expression, the distinctive beauties of the original Latin or Greek.
"In the scattered lessons I used to set myself," he said, "I translated
above a quarter of the Metamorphoses, and that part of Statius which was
afterwards printed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> the corrections of Walsh."<a name="FNanchor_6_264" id="FNanchor_6_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_264" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The notion, in
which Bowles and others acquiesced, that the published translations are
a true index of Pope's skill at fourteen, will not bear investigation.
Of the Metamorphoses he brought out only two little fragments, which
appeared many years later, when they had undergone a thorough revision.
The rest of the manuscript would not have been sacrificed if the version
had been fit for the public eye without the toil of recasting it.
Spence, who possessed the Acis and Galatea, did not think it worth
printing as a specimen of Pope's boyish abilities, even when the
curiosity respecting his works was at its height. The suppression of all
his early pieces, which had not been submitted to a subsequent
renovation, is a plain proof of their inferiority. The first translation
which he gave to the world was the "Episode of Sarpedon, from the
twelfth and sixteenth books of Homer's Iliads." This, and his Pastorals,
appeared together, in May, 1709, in Tonson's Sixth Miscellany, and Pope
was then twenty-one.</p>

<p>The fragment from Homer included the speech of Sarpedon to Glaucus. "It
has," said the poet, "been rendered in English by Sir John Denham, after
whom the translator had not the vanity to attempt it for any other
reason, than that the episode must have been very imperfect without so
noble a part of it." Denham at that period had a much more brilliant
reputation than he afterwards retained, and though Pope adopted the
language of humility, he must have felt an inward pride in the
consciousness that he had distanced so famous a name. His great
superiority did not admit of a question, and he must have been well
aware that it was his interest to invite a comparison. The specimen was
shown in manuscript to Trumbull, who, in his admiration, urged Pope to
give a complete translation of the Iliad. The exhortations of Trumbull
did not bear fruit till 1713. "I cannot," Pope wrote to him in the
November of that year, "deny myself the pleasure of acquainting you how
great a proof I have given of my deference to your opinion and judgment,
which has at last moved me to undertake the translation of Homer. I can
honestly say Sir William Trumbull was not only the first that put this
into my thoughts, but the principal encourager I had in it, and though
now almost all the distinguished names of quality or learning in the
nation have subscribed to it, there is not one of which I am so proud as
of yours." When the first volume of the translation appeared in 1715,
Pope paid his acknowledgments in the Preface to the eminent men who had
specially patronised the work. Not only does he make no mention of
Trumbull, but he professes to have yielded to the counsel of a greater
authority, and says, "Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined
me to undertake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> the task." Either the statement in the Preface, or the
statement in the letter must be inaccurate, though both Addison and
Trumbull may have recommended the scheme.</p>

<p>The "Episode of Sarpedon" is now incorporated in the complete
translation to which it led the way. It was not till three years after
he had published the fragment from Homer that Pope brought out his
translations from the Latin, of which the most ambitious is his version
of the first book of the Thebais. He told Spence that in his boyhood "he
liked extremely a translation of a part of Statius by some very bad
hand." This work bore the title of "An Essay upon Statius, or the five
first books of P. P. Statius his Thebais. Done into English verse by
T[homas] S[tephens], London, 1648." The verse into which Stephens did
his author was for the most part rugged and prosaic, but a few passages
are happily turned, and his successor did not disdain to borrow some
lines and phrases from him. The principal advantage, however, to Pope of
Stephens's attempt was that it enabled him to interpret the original;
for his classical education had been defective, and it is clear from his
own account, that he could not, without assistance, have construed the
Thebais correctly. At eight years of age he was taught his accidence by
a priest.<a name="FNanchor_7_265" id="FNanchor_7_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_265" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He afterwards went to a couple of small schools, where "he
lost what he had gained" from his first instructor.<a name="FNanchor_8_266" id="FNanchor_8_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_266" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> "When I came," he
said, "from the last of them, all the acquisition I had made was to be
able to construe a little of Tully's Offices."<a name="FNanchor_9_267" id="FNanchor_9_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_267" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> For a few months he
had another priest for his tutor, and was then left, between twelve and
thirteen, to his own resources.<a name="FNanchor_10_268" id="FNanchor_10_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_268" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The foundation was slight, and he
proceeded to raise upon it a hasty superstructure. "I did not," he said,
"follow the grammar, but rather hunted in the authors for a syntax of my
own; and then began translating any parts that pleased me, particularly
in the best Greek and Latin poets. I got the languages by hunting after
the stories in the several poets I read, rather than read the books to
get the language."<a name="FNanchor_11_269" id="FNanchor_11_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_269" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He, on another occasion, told Spence that he
thought himself the better in some respects for not having had a regular
education, since it caused him to read for the sense, whereas schoolboys
were taught to read for words.<a name="FNanchor_12_270" id="FNanchor_12_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_270" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The process was fatal to scholarship.
Ignorant, in a great degree, of the rules and idioms of the Latin
tongue, it was impossible he should translate with ease or accuracy. But
his peculiar training doubtless favoured the early development of his
poetic powers. He devoted his boyish years, when the mind was most
pliable, to the cultivation of his art, and this incessant practice of
versification from childhood was the cause of his precocious
excellence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Pope's admiration for Statius continued throughout his later boyhood,
and he preferred him to "all the Latin poets, by much, next to
Virgil."<a name="FNanchor_13_271" id="FNanchor_13_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_271" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He soon began to turn the Thebais into English, and he
affirms that his version of the first book was made in 1703. In a note
to his letter to Cromwell of Jan. 22, 1709, he placed it earlier still,
and declares that it was "done when the author was but fourteen years
old." These statements convey an erroneous impression. It appears from
the correspondence with Cromwell that more than one-third of the
translation was not in existence by January, 1709, when Pope was in his
twenty-first year. The piece was not published till 1712, when it came
out in Lintot's Miscellany, and the poet at that period was twenty-four.
The portions which were not recently translated, were newly corrected,
and the whole represents the powers of the man who completed the task,
and not of the boy who commenced it.</p>

<p>The translation of the first book of the Thebais must be more highly
estimated as a specimen of versification than as an adequate
representation of the original. The harmony and phraseology of
particular passages are delicious, and verse and language throughout are
polished in a high degree. There is one pervading exception to Pope's
metrical skill. He has recourse incessantly to an unnatural order of
words, and especially he produces his rhymes by placing the verb after
the noun it ought to precede. Of this license Dryden says, "We were
whipped at Westminster if we used it twice together. I should judge him
to have little command of English whom the necessity of a rhyme should
force upon this rock, though sometimes it cannot easily be avoided."
Pope availed himself of the false construction with a freedom which
seriously deforms and enfeebles much of his poetry. He fell into the
error before he had discrimination to perceive the blemish, and when his
judgment was more mature habit had reconciled him to the distortion.</p>

<p>Warton has not exaggerated the defects of Statius, but he has underrated
his merits. The descriptions in the Thebais are vivid, and abound in
picturesque circumstances, and natural traits of character. Pope's
translation is more vague. His narrative is less perspicuous, less
dramatic, less spirited, and less life-like than the original. "There
are numberless particulars blameworthy in our author," Pope wrote to
Cromwell, "which I have tried to soften in the version."<a name="FNanchor_14_272" id="FNanchor_14_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_272" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He was not
successful in this attempt. Where he departs from his text he seldom
tempers an extravagance, and has more often rejected a beauty, or
smoothed it down into insipidity. His juvenile taste was for polished
generalities, and he shunned circumstantial nature. He had still less
relish for primitive simplicity, and he thought that some of the
incidents in the Thebais were too humble to be endured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"When Statius," he says, "comes to the scene of his poem, and the prize
in dispute between the brothers, he gives us a very mean opinion of
it,&mdash;<i>pugna est de paupere regno</i>&mdash;very different from the conduct of
his master, Virgil, who at the entrance of his poem informs the reader
of the greatness of his subject."<a name="FNanchor_15_273" id="FNanchor_15_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_273" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Pope was led astray by the
equivocal meaning of a word. There is no connection between the
greatness of a kingdom, and the greatness of a theme for poetic
purposes. The poverty of Scotland did not detract from the tragic
grandeur of Macbeth. When the fugitive princes in the Thebais quarrel in
the vestibule, where they have taken shelter from the storm, and fight
with their fists, Pope confused the narrative by omitting the whole
account as inconsistent with epic dignity, and sacrificed the
characteristics of the original to assimilate the manners to modern
usages. If his criticisms had been well founded he should yet have kept
to his text. "The sense of an author," says Dryden, "is, generally
speaking, to be sacred and inviolable. If the fancy of Ovid be
luxuriant, it is his character to be so; and, if I retrench it, he is no
longer Ovid. It will be replied that he receives advantage by this
lopping of his superfluous branches; but I rejoin that a translator has
no such right. When a painter copies from the life, I suppose he has no
privilege to alter features and lineaments, under pretence that his
picture will look better; perhaps the face which he has drawn would be
more exact if the eyes or nose were altered; but it is his business to
make it resemble the original." Pope has rendered a few passages with
equal beauty and truth, but on the whole the antique colouring, the
dramatic traits, and picturesque details are very imperfectly preserved.</p>

<h2>ARGUMENT</h2>


<p>&OElig;dipus, King of Thebes, having by mistake slain his father Laius, and
married his mother Jocasta, put out his own eyes, and resigned the realm
to his sons, Eteocles and Polynices. Being neglected by them, he makes
his prayer to the Fury Tisiphone, to sow debate betwixt the brothers.
They agree at last to reign singly, each a year by turns, and the first
lot is obtained by Eteocles. Jupiter, in a council of the gods, declares
his resolution of punishing the Thebans, and Argives also, by means of a
marriage betwixt Polynices and one of the daughters of Adrastus, king of
Argos. Juno opposes, but to no effect, and Mercury is sent on a message
to the shades, to the ghost of Laius, who is to appear to Eteocles, and
provoke him to break the agreement. Polynices in the meantime departs
from Thebes by night, is overtaken by a storm, and arrives at Argos,
where he meets with Tydeus, who had fled from Calydon, having killed his
brother. Adrastus entertains them, having received an oracle from Apollo
that his daughters should be married to a boar and a lion, which he
understands to be meant of these strangers, by whom the hides of those
beasts were worn, and who arrived at the time when he kept an annual
feast in honour of that god. The rise of this solemnity he relates to
his guests, the loves of Ph&oelig;bus and Psamathe, and the story of
Chor&oelig;bus. He inquires, and is made acquainted with their descent and
quality. The sacrifice is renewed, and the book concludes with a hymn to
Apollo.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_274" id="Footnote_1_274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_274"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> "Dire," in the Latin sense of ill-omened.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_275" id="Footnote_2_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_275"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> When Jupiter had carried off Europa, her father, Agenor,
sent her brother Cadmus to seek her, and commanded him not to return
without his sister. Unable to find her he settled at Thebes, and built
the city. He slew the dragon, which guarded a neighbouring well, and a
portion of the armed men, who sprung up from its teeth, were reputed to
be the ancestors of the Thebans.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_276" id="Footnote_3_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_276"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> A second legend ascribed the building of the city to the
wonder-working music of Amphion, which caused the stones to pile
themselves together. Both legends were subsequently blended, and Cadmus
had the credit of the upper part of the city, and Amphion of the lower.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_277" id="Footnote_4_277"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_277"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Juno visited Athamas, king of Thebes, with madness, and in
his frenzy he shot his own son, Learchus, whom he took for a young lion.
Upon this his wife, Ino, who was a daughter of Cadmus, fled with her
second son, Melicertes, and threw herself and her boy into the sea.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_278" id="Footnote_5_278"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_278"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Domitian. The panegyric on this timid and cruel tyrant was
disgraceful flattery. The boasted victories over the Dacian's were in
reality defeats. They compelled the emperor to sue for an inglorious
peace which was only purchased by the promise of an immediate ransom and
an annual tribute. Most of his pretended triumphs were of a similar
character, and led Pliny the younger to remark, that they were always
the token of some advantage obtained by the enemies of Rome.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_279" id="Footnote_6_279"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_279"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> During the contest between Vespasian and Vitellius for the
empire, Domitian, at the age of eighteen, took refuge in the temple of
the Capitol to escape from the fury of the soldiers opposed to his
father. It was self-preservation and not daring which impelled him, and
when the temple of Jupiter was set on fire he again fled, and hid
himself until the party of Vespasian prevailed.</p></div>

The rival brothers ultimately engaged in single combat, and both fell.
The body of Polynices was placed by mistake upon the funeral pile of
Eteocles, and the flames rose upwards in diverging currents.</p></div>

other, and they afterwards united in a common stream. Both were mere
watercourses, which were only filled by the rains of winter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_285" id="Footnote_12_285"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_285"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The Thebans are subsequently represented by Statius as
driven into the Ismenus by the Greeks, and the hosts which were killed
or drowned were carried by the river into the sea.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_286" id="Footnote_13_286"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_286"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> What hero, that is, of the famous seven who went up
against Thebes to dispossess Eteocles for violating the compact to reign
alternately with Polynices. The five persons whom Statius enumerates as
joining with Polynices and Adrastus, king of Argos, are Tydeus,
Amphiaraus, Hippomedon, Parthenop&aelig;us, and Capaneus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_287" id="Footnote_14_287"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_287"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> When Tydeus had received his death-wound from a javelin
hurled by Menalippus, he gathered up his failing strength, and flung a
dart by which he mortally wounded Menalippus in turn. Full of revengeful
spite Tydeus begged that the head of Menalippus might be brought to him.
He grasped it with his dying hand, gazed at it with malignant joy,
gnawed it in his frenzy, and refused to relinquish his hold. This was
"the rage of Tydeus," which Statius says the Greeks themselves condemned
as exceeding the recognised latitude of hate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_288" id="Footnote_15_288"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_288"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The prophet was Amphiaraus, who predicted that all who
took part in the expedition, except Adrastus, would be destroyed. The
earth opened while Amphiaraus was fighting, and swallowed up him and his
chariot. Statius paints him sinking calmly into the yawning gulf,
without dropping his weapons or the reins, and with his eyes fixed on
the heavens.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_289" id="Footnote_16_289"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_289"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Hippomedon is made by Statius the hero of the conflict in
the river Ismenus, where he at last succumbs to the god of the river.
The piles of dead formed a dike, which turned back the waters.</p></div>

ascending the walls of Thebes. Jupiter punished his defiance by setting
him on fire with lightning on the scaling ladder, and he was burnt to
death.</p></div>

perceived and felt from the reserved manner in which Sophocles speaks of
the dreadful incest of &OElig;dipus, and from the manner in which Statius
has enlarged and dwelt upon it, in which he has been very unnaturally
and injudiciously imitated by Dryden and Lee, who introduce this most
unfortunate prince not only describing but arguing on the dreadful crime
he had committed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_295" id="Footnote_22_295"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_295"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Laius, king of Thebes, warned by the oracle that he would
be killed by his own offspring, exposed his son &OElig;dipus on Mount
Cith&aelig;ron. The infant was found by a shepherd, and carried to Polybus,
king of Corinth, who adopted him. Arrived at man's estate, he too was
informed by the oracle that he would take the life of his father, and
commit incest with his mother. Believing that the king and queen who
brought him up were his parents, he determined not to go back to
Corinth, and in attempting to avert his destiny, he fulfilled it. As he
journeyed towards Thebes he met his real father, Laius, and slew him in
a conflict which grew out of a dispute with his charioteer.</p></div>

riddle to every one who passed by, and destroying all who were unable to
explain it. The Thebans proclaimed that whoever would rid the kingdom of
this scourge should marry the widow of Laius, and succeed to the vacant
throne. &OElig;dipus, by solving the riddle, drove the Sphinx to commit
suicide, and in accepting the reward, he unconsciously verified the
remainder of the oracle.</p></div>

animarum examine campos," "the plains darkened with a swarm of ghosts."
"Lucentes equos," he translates, "fair glories," omitting the image
entirely. To mount Atlas he has added an idea which makes the passage
more ridiculous than sublime. It is poorly expressed in the original; in
the translation it is ludicrous; "and shook the heavens <i>and gods he
bore</i>." There are many images which if indistinctly seen are sublime; if
particularised they become quite the contrary. However, the translation
is certainly wonderful, when the age of the author is considered. It
shows his powers of metrical language, at so early a period of his

became marine divinities, and their names were changed to Leucothea and
Pal&aelig;mon. Statius is more picturesque than Pope. When the apparition of
the Fury announced terrible evils to come, the sea was stirred to its
depths. On the outburst of the tempest, Pal&aelig;mon was sailing about on the
back of a dolphin, and it was then that his mother snatched him up in
her alarm, and pressed him to her bosom. To convey an idea of the
tremendous nature of the storm, Statius says that the Corinthian isthmus
could hardly resist the violence of the waves which dashed against each
of its shores. This circumstance is justly styled by Pope "most
extravagantly hyperbolical," but a translator should not have omitted
it.</p></div>

been suggested by his hostility to the revolution of 1688. Nor does
Statius call the populace "vile," or say that they are always
"discontented," or that they are "still prone to change, though still
the slaves of state." Neither does he say that they "are sure to hate
the monarch, they have," but he says that their custom is to love his
successor, which is a sentiment more in accordance with experience.</p></div>

original. It is there said that Jupiter at his first entrance seats
himself upon his starry throne, but that the other gods did not presume
to sit down "protinus," that is, in immediate succession to Jupiter, and
interpreting his example as a tacit license to do so, until, by a gentle
wave of his hand, the supreme father signifies his express permission to
take their seats. In Pope's translation, the whole picturesque solemnity
of the celestial ritual melts into the vaguest generalities.&mdash;<span class="smcap">De
Quincey.</span>

De Quincey was mistaken in his inference that Pope was unable to

that the fires of the &AElig;olian forge were exhausted was doubtless
introduced by Statius because in his day the eruptions had ceased in
Hiera.</p></div>

"This," remarked Pope, "could hardly be; for the isthmus of Corinth is

"a geographical error." It was his own geography that was at fault. The
width of the isthmus is only three miles and a half. Pope spoilt the

Pope appears to have thought that this was derogatory to the character
of the fugitive king, and he calls him, when gazing on the ravages
caused by the storm, "the intrepid Theban," which conveys the impression
that he was undaunted by the spectacle. In the same spirit Pope at ver.
527, has the line, "Thus still his <i>courage</i> with his toils increased,"
where the original says that the stimulus which urged him on was fear.
But while Pope has obliterated the alarm which was generated by the
tempest he has introduced in its place an alarm which had no existence.
In the midst of the havoc worked by the elements the recollection of his
brother "wings the feet" of the intrepid Theban "with fears," though he
is beyond his brother's reach, and has no suspicion at present that he
designs to break the compact to reign alternately. The influence which
the remembrance of Eteocles exercised over the mind of the wanderer is
expressly distinguished by Statius from the fear, and means no more than
that since Polynices was an exile from Thebes, he was compelled to
proceed onwards till he could find an asylum in another state.</p></div>

king and gained admission to the palace, is not told by Pope, who has
left upwards of seventy lines untranslated, and by the mutilation
rendered the incidents improbable. Polynices reaches the palace first
and lies down, worn out, on the pavement of the vestibule. Tydeus
arrives at the same spot, and Polynices is unwilling that he should
share the shelter. A quarrel ensues, and from words they proceed to
blows. The king is disturbed by the uproar; he issues forth from the
palace with attendants and torches to ascertain the cause; explanations
follow, and these result in Tydeus and Polynices becoming the guests of
Adrastus. "There is an odd account," Pope says to Cromwell, "of an
unmannerly battle at fisty-cuffs between the two Princes on a very
slight occasion, and at a time when, one would think, the fatigue of
their journey, in so tempestuous a night, might have rendered them very
unfit for such a scuffle. This I had actually translated, but was very

Apollo intrigued with Coronis, the daughter of Phlegyas. Her enraged
father retaliated by firing the temple of Apollo, and was consigned for
his rebellion to perpetual torture in the infernal regions. His terror
lest the impending rock should crush him is a circumstance interpolated
by Pope from Virgil's description of the punishment of Pirithous and

in caves, or, as Pope has it, in "hollow rocks," because the spherical
form of the cave symbolised the universe, of which Mithras was the
maker. The "blaze of light which adorns his head" in Pope's version,
makes no part of the description in the original. The final line is
explained by several ancient works of art, in which a man, wearing a
Phrygian cap, is depicted cutting the throat of a bull he has flung to
the ground. The man is said by an old scholiast on Statius to typify the
sun, the bull the moon, and the intention, he states, is to represent
the superiority of the sun over the moon. Statius speaks of the bull as
indignant at being compelled to follow Mithras,&mdash;an idea which suits ill
with the tranquil aspect of the moon as it floats through the heavens.</p></div>

<h2>TRANSLATIONS</h2>

<h4>FROM</h4>

<h2>OVID.</h2>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>Great is the change in passing from Statius to Ovid; from force to
facility of style; from thoughts and images which are too much studied
and unnatural to such as are obvious, careless, and familiar. Ovid seems
to have had the merit of inventing this beautiful species of writing
epistles under feigned names. It is a high improvement on the Greek
elegy, to which its dramatic form renders it much superior. The judgment
of the writer must chiefly appear by opening the complaint of the person
introduced, just at such a period of time, as will give occasion for the
most tender sentiments, and the most sudden, and violent turns of
passion to be displayed. Ovid may perhaps be blamed for a sameness of
subjects in these epistles of his heroines; and his epistles are
likewise too long, which circumstance has forced him into a repetition
and languor in the sentiments. On the whole the epistle before us is
translated by Pope with faithfulness and with elegance, and much excels
any Dryden translated in the volume he published, several of which were
done by some "of the mob of gentlemen that wrote with ease,"&mdash;that is,
Sir C. Scrope, Caryll, Pooly, Wright, Tate, Buckingham, Cooper, and
other careless rhymers. Lord Somers translated Dido to &AElig;neas, and
Ariadne to Theseus. Though I regret the hours our poet spent in
translating Ovid and Statius, yet it has given us an opportunity of
admiring his good sense and judgment, in not suffering his taste and
style, in his succeeding works, to be infected with the faults of these
two writers.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>Warton says, "The judgment of the writer must chiefly appear by opening
the complaint of the person introduced at such a period of time as will
give occasion for the most tender sentiments." How beautifully is this
displayed in Pope's Epistle to Abelard, a poem that has another most
interesting circumstance, which Ovid appears, as well as our Drayton, to
have neglected,&mdash;I mean the introduction of appropriate and descriptive
imagery, which relieves and recreates the fancy by the pictures, and by
the landscapes which accompany the characters. Ovid, in this Epistle,
seems not insensible to the effect of the introduction of such scenes;
and the Leucadian rock, the <i>antra nemusque</i>, the aquatic lotus, the
sacred pellucid fountain, and particularly the genius of the place, the
Naiad, addressing the despairing Sappho (which circumstance Pope has
beautifully imitated and improved in Eloisa), are in the genuine spirit
of poetical taste. Dr. Warton observes that this translation is superior
to any of Dryden's. If, indeed, we compare Pope's translations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> with
those of any other writer, their superiority must be strikingly
apparent. There is a finish in them, a correctness, a natural flow, and
a tone of originality, added to a wonderful propriety and beauty of
expression and language. If he ever fails, it is where he generalises
too much. This is particularly objectionable, where in the original
there is any marked, distinct, and beautiful picture. So, ver. 253, Pope
only says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cupid for thee shall spread the swelling sail;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>whereas in Ovid, Cupid appears before us in the very act of guiding the
vessel, seated as the pilot, and with his <i>tender</i> hand (<i>tener&acirc; manu</i>)
contracting, or letting flow the sail. I need not point out another
beauty in the original,&mdash;the repetition of the word <i>Ipse</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>Richardson has appended this note to the Epistle of Sappho to Phaon in
his copy of the quarto of 1717: "Corrected by the first copy, written
out elegantly (as all his MSS.) to show friends, with their remarks in
the margin; the present reading for the most part the effect of them."
The remarks in the margin are mere exclamations, such as "pulchre,"
"bene," "optime," "recte," "bella paraphrasis," "longe pr&aelig;stas Scrope
meo judicio," "minus placet," &amp;c. They are doubtless from the pen of
Cromwell, since it appeals from Pope's letter to him on June 10, 1709,
that he had jotted down the same phrases on the margin of the
translation of Statius. Bowles having quoted the observation of Warton,
"that he had seen compositions of youths of sixteen years old far beyond
the Pastorals in point of genius and imagination," adds, "I fear not to
assert that he never could have seen any compositions of boys of that
age so perfect in versification, so copious, yet so nice in expression,
so correct, so spirited, and so finished," as the translation of the
Epistle of Sappho to Phaon. The remark was made by Bowles in the belief
that the version was the production of the poet's fourteenth year. Pope
himself records on his manuscript that it was "written first 1707." He
was then nineteen, and when the Epistle was published in 1712, in
Tonson's Ovid, he was twenty-four.</p>

<p>"Ovid," says Dryden, "often writ too pointedly for his subject, and made
his persons speak more eloquently than the violence of their passions
would admit." Passion is sometimes highly eloquent; feeling strongly it
expresses itself forcibly, and Dryden meant that the characters in Ovid,
by their numerous strokes of studied brilliancy, seemed to be carried
away less by their emotions than by the ambition to shine. These
glittering artifices were formerly called wit, and Dryden complains that
Ovid "is frequently witty out of season," but they are not wit in our
present sense of the word. Occasionally they are the far-fetched or
affected prettinesses which are properly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> called conceits; and more
commonly they consist in terse antithesis, and a sparkle of words
produced by the balanced repetition of a phrase. They are often as
appropriate as they are showy, and if they are among the blemishes they
are conspicuous among the beauties of Ovid. His writings are marked by
opposite qualities. He is sometimes too artificial in his expression of
the passions, and sometimes he is natural, glowing, and pathetic. He
abounds in pointed sentences, and is not less distinguished for the
easy, spontaneous flow of his language. He is at once prolix and
concise, indulging in a single vein of thought till the monotony becomes
tedious, and yet enunciating his ideas with sententious brevity. The
condensation of the Latin in many places cannot be preserved in the
diffuser idioms of our English tongue, but, if we overlook a few weak
couplets, Pope has translated the Epistle of Sappho to Phaon with rare
felicity, and notwithstanding the inevitable loss of some happy turns of
expression, he has managed to retain both the passion and the poetry.
Effusions of sentiment were better adapted to his genius than the heroic
narrative of the Thebais; and his limpid measure, which neither
resembled the numerous and robuster verse of Statius, nor was suited to
an epic theme, accorded with the sweetness and uniformity of Ovid's
verse, and with the outpourings of grief and tenderness which are the
staple of these epistolary strains. There is no ground for the regret of
Warton that Pope should have spent a little time in translating portions
of Ovid and Statius. It would be as reasonable to lament that he stooped
to the preliminary discipline which made him a poet. He has related that
he did not take to translation till he found himself unequal to original
composition, and, like all who excel in any department, he learnt, by
copying his predecessors, to rival them.</p>

married her.</p></div>

mother's vanity, and rid the land of the scourge, Cepheus agreed to
offer up Andromeda to the monster. She was chained to a rock on the
coast, where Perseus saw her at the critical moment when she was about
to be devoured. Captivated by her charms he engaged and slew the
monster, and made Andromeda his wife.</p></div>

which he thinks flat and languid: but the simplicity of the appeal to
the blot on her paper is admirable, and should be only mentioned as a
fact. The imitator has destroyed the whole beauty of the line, by a
quaint antithesis, and a laboured arrangement of words, which are not
natural in affliction. Scrope's translation again excels Pope's:

<p>
Tereus married Progne, and afterwards fell in love with her sister
Philomela. Both sisters conspired to revenge themselves upon him. They
killed Itys, his son by Progne, gave him some of the flesh to eat. When,
with savage exultation, they revealed the truth to him, and he was about
to slay them, Progne was changed into a swallow, and Philomela into a
nightingale.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_435" id="Footnote_30_435"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_435"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The Sappho of Ovid only says that she laid down upon the
bank worn out with weeping. Pope is answerable for the extravagant
conceit of "her swelling the flood with her tears." In the next verse
Pope calls the Naiad "a watery virgin,"&mdash;an expression which borders on
the ludicrous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_436" id="Footnote_31_436"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_436"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> There was a promontory in Acarnania called Leucate, on the
top of which was a little temple dedicated to Apollo. In this temple it
was usual for despairing lovers to make their vows in secret, and
afterwards to fling themselves from the top of the precipice into the
sea; for it was an established opinion that all those who were taken up
alive would be cured of their former passion. Sappho tried the remedy,
but perished in the experiment.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fawkes.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_437" id="Footnote_32_437"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_437"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Ale&aelig;us arrived at the promontory of Leucate that very

mellifluous in our language; and they are supposed to derive their
sweetness and harmony from the mixture of so many iambics. Pope himself

</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Not all the gods shall force me then away;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For thou alone art all the gods to me.<br /></span>

Another version ran thus:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou return, oh more than Ph&oelig;bus, fair<br /></span>

<p>
Cromwell wrote against the last line "recte, non pulchre," and Pope
tried three variations of it before he cast them aside for the version
in the text:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

as printed, but objected [against] as tautological. <i>Sic recte</i> as [in
the] margin, but carried afterwards as at first." "Sighs" was thought to
be too nearly synonymous with "prayers," and Pope altered the lines by
erasing the expressions "no sighs" and "my sighs," and affixing the
epithet "tender" in both verses to numbers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_445" id="Footnote_40_445"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_445"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> This image is very inferior to the original, as it is more
vague and general: the picture in the original is strikingly beautiful.
The circumstances which make it so, are omitted by Pope:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ipse gubernabit residens in puppe Cupido,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ipse dabit tenera vela legetque manu.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The objection of Bowles would not have applied to the manuscript, where
this admirable couplet, which Pope unwisely omitted, follows the lines
in the text:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shall take the rudder in his tender hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And steer thee safe to this forsaken land.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
There is a second, but inferior rendering:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shall sit presiding on the painted prore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And steer thy ship to this forsaken shore.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Cromwell applied the words of Horace, "qu&aelig; desperat nitescere posse,
relinquit," which seems intended to intimate that it was impossible to
give a poetical translation of the original. Pope deferred to the
mistaken criticism.</p></div>

<span class="i0">She<a name="FNanchor_2_447" id="FNanchor_2_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_447" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> said, and for her lost Galanthis sighs,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A nearer woe, a sister's stranger fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No nymph of all &OElig;chalia could compare<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This nymph compressed by him who rules the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Delphi and the Delian isle obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Andr&aelig;mon loved; and, blessed in all those charms<br /></span>

<span class="i2">A lake there was, with shelving banks around,<span class='linenum'>15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose verdant summit fragrant myrtles crowned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These shades, unknowing of the fates, she sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the naiads flow'ry garlands brought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her smiling babe (a pleasing charge) she pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her arms, and nourished at her breast.<span class='linenum'>20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor distant far a wat'ry lotos grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spring was new, and all the verdant boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned with blossoms, promised fruits that vie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In glowing colours with the Tyrian dye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these she cropped to please her infant son,<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I myself the same rash act had done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo! I saw (as near her side I stood,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violated blossoms<a name="FNanchor_7_452" id="FNanchor_7_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_452" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> drop with blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the tree I cast a frightful look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling tree with sudden horror shook.<span class='linenum'>30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lotis the nymph (if rural tales be true)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from Priapus' lawless lust she flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsook her form; and fixing here, became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flow'ry plant, which still preserves her name.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This change unknown, astonished at the sight,<span class='linenum'>35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My trembling sister strove to urge her flight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first the pardon of the nymphs implored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those offended sylvan pow'rs adored:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she backward would have fled, she found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her stiff'ning feet were rooted in the ground:<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain to free her fastened feet she strove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as she struggles, only moves above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She feels th' encroaching bark around her grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By quick degrees, and cover all below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surprized at this, her trembling hand she heaves<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rend her hair; her hand is filled with leaves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where late was hair the shooting leaves are seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rise, and shade her with a sudden green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child Amphissus, to her bosom pressed,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span><span class="i0">Perceived a colder and a harder breast,<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found the springs, that ne'er till then denied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their milky moisture, on a sudden dried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, unhappy! what I now relate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood the helpless witness of thy fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embraced thy boughs, thy rising bark delayed,<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There wished to grow, and mingle shade with shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Behold Andr&aelig;mon and th' unhappy sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appear, and for their Dryope inquire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A springing tree for Dryope they find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And print warm kisses on the panting rind;<span class='linenum'>60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prostrate, with tears their kindred plant bedew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From ev'ry leaf distils a trickling tear,<br /></span>

expression. "Sounding" is a feeble epithet to be applied to the axe by
Dryope, who was thinking of the wounds it would inflict upon her; and it
is still more inappropriate to make her call her transformation, "my
honours," when she regarded the metamorphose with dismay. How superior
to Pope's diluted version is the brief and simple language of the
original,&mdash;"et c&aelig;sa securibus urar." Sandys is better than Pope in the

<h2>JANUARY AND MAY:</h2>

<h4>OR,</h4>

<h2>THE MERCHANT'S TALE.</h2>

<h3>FROM CHAUCER.</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>This translation was done at sixteen or seventeen years of age.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p>

<p>The story of January and May now before us is of the comic kind; and the
character of a fond old dotard betrayed into disgrace by an unsuitable
match is supported in a lively manner. Pope has nowhere copied the free
and easy versification, and the narrative style of Dryden's Fables, so
happily as in this pleasant tale. He has endeavoured suitably to
familiarise the stateliness of our heroic measure; but, after all his
pains, this measure is not adapted to such subjects so well as the lines
of four feet, or the French numbers of Fontaine. Fontaine is, in truth,
the capital and unrivalled writer of comic tales. He generally took his
subjects from Boccacio, Poggius, and Ariosto; but adorned them with so
many natural strokes, with such quaintness in his reflections, and such
a dryness and archness of humour, as cannot fail to excite laughter. Our
Prior has happily caught his manner in many of his lighter tales,
particularly in Hans Carvel. Of the tale before us, Mr. Tyrwhitt gives
the following account:&mdash;"The scene of the Merchant's Tale is laid in
Italy; but none of the names, except Damian and Justin, seem to be
Italian, but rather made at pleasure; so that I doubt whether the story
be really of Italian growth. The adventure of the pear-tree I find in a
small collection of Latin fables, written by one Adolphus, in elegiac
verses of his fashion, in the year 1315. This fable has never been
printed but once, and in a book not commonly to be met with. Whatever
was the real original of this tale, the machinery of the fairies, which
Chaucer has used so happily, was probably added by himself; and indeed I
cannot help thinking that his Pluto and Proserpine were the true
progenitors of Oberon and Titania, or rather that they themselves have,
once at least, deigned to revisit our poetical system under the latter
names. In the History of English Poetry, this is said to be an old
Lombard story. But many passages in it are evidently taken from the
Polycraticon of John of Salisbury: De molestiis et oneribus conjugiorum
secundum Hieronymum et alios philosophos&mdash;Et de pernicie libidinis&mdash;Et
de mulieris Ephesin&aelig; et similium fide. And, by the way, about forty
verses belonging to this argument are translated from the same chapter
of the Polycraticon, in the Wife of Bath's prologue. In the meantime, it
is not improbable that this tale might have originally been oriental. A
Persian tale is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> just published which it extremely resembles; and it has
much of the allegory of an eastern apologue."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>In the art of telling a story in verse, Pope is peculiarly happy; we
almost forget the grossness of the subject of this tale, while we are
struck by the uncommon ease and readiness of the verse, the suitableness
of the expressions, and the spirit and happiness of the whole. I think
Dr. Warton injudiciously censures the verse, which appears to me to be
very suitably employed. Pope has introduced triplets in many places, no
doubt for greater effect, which they certainly have. There is generally
two together, ended with an Alexandrine. This is common in Dryden's
fables, on which Pope evidently formed his style in these narrative
pieces. When I say that Dr. Warton injudiciously objects to the verse,
it should be remembered that there is a mock-elevation in the speeches,
descriptions, &amp;c., of this story, and even poetry in the fairy revels,
for which the versification Pope has chosen is more proper, than it
would be for Prior's burlesque, and less poetical, ribaldry. The mixture
of classical and gothic imagery, such as Chaucer uses, in making Pluto
and Proserpine, instead of spirits, like Oberon and Titania, the king
and queen of the "yellow-skirted fays," is very common in our early
poets, who derived the combination from the old romances, and
Ovid.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>When Dryden published his version of some of Chaucer's Tales he gave, in
his preface, an excellent account of the characteristics of the
original. "As Chaucer," he said, "is the father of English poetry, so I
hold him in the same degree of veneration as the Grecians held Homer, or
the Romans Virgil. He is a perpetual fountain of good sense,&mdash;learned in
all sciences, and therefore speaks properly on all subjects. He must
have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature, because, as it
has been truly observed of him, he has taken into the compass of his
Canterbury Tales the various manners, and humours, as we now call them,
of the whole English nation in his age. Not a single character has
escaped him. All his pilgrims are severally distinguished from each
other, and not only in their inclinations, but in their very
physiognomies and persons. I see them as perfectly before me,&mdash;their
humours, their features, and their very dress&mdash;as distinctly as if I had
supped with them at the Tabard in Southwark. The matter and manner of
their tales, and of their telling, are so suited to their different
educations, humours, and callings, that each of them would be improper
in any other mouth. Even the grave and serious characters are
distinguished by their several sorts of gravity. Their discourses are
such as belong to their age, their calling, and their breeding,&mdash;such as
are becoming of them, and of them only. Some of his persons are vicious,
and some virtuous; some are unlearned, or, as Chaucer calls them, lewd,
and some are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> learned. Even the ribaldry of the low characters is
different. The reeve, the miller, and the cook are several men, and
distinguished from each other as much as the mincing lady prioress, and
the broad-speaking, gap-toothed wife of Bath. We have our forefathers,
and great grand-dames all before us, as they were in Chaucer's days.
Their general characters are still remaining in mankind, and even in
England, though they are called by other names than those of monks and
friars, and canons, and lady abesses, and nuns: for mankind is ever the
same, and nothing lost out of nature, though everything is altered."
There were two classes of readers who exclaimed against the attempt to
renovate the original,&mdash;those who held that it was too bad to be
reproduced, and those who considered it too excellent to be remodelled
without being spoiled. "I find," writes Dryden, "some people are
offended that I have turned these tales into modern English, because
they think them unworthy of my pains, and look on Chaucer as a dry,
old-fashioned wit, not worth reviving. I have often heard the late Earl
of Leicester say that Mr. Cowley himself was of that opinion, who having
read him over at my lord's request, declared he had no taste of him.
Being shocked perhaps with his old style, he never examined into the
depth of his good sense. Chaucer, I confess, is a rough diamond, and
must first be polished ere he shines. But there are other judges who
think I ought not to have translated him into English out of a quite
contrary notion. They suppose there is a certain veneration due to his
old language, and that it is little less than profanation and sacrilege
to alter it. They are further of opinion that somewhat of his good sense
will suffer in the transfusion, and much of the beauty of his thoughts
will infallibly be lost, which appear with more grace in their old
habit. Of this opinion was the Earl of Leicester, who valued Chaucer as
much as Mr. Cowley despised him." Dryden replied that his version was
only intended for those to whom the original was unintelligible, and
while allowing that the original was superior to the copy, he contended
that the copy was to be preferred to a blank. If he had confined himself
simply to modernising his author there would have been little force in
his plea. The phraseology of Chaucer is readily mastered, and any
departure from his words destroys a large part of the charm. There is a
native simplicity in the medi&aelig;val works of genius which pleases like the
artless manners of children, but which would be as ridiculous in a
modern dress as the manners of the child in a grown-up person. Nor must
we overlook the superior interest which attaches to the notions, usages,
and characters of our ancestors when the picture is painted by
themselves. A copy in which costumes and colouring have been completely
changed is but an adulterate representation. The antique peculiarities
and primitive freshness are gone. The real justification of Dryden's
undertaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> was not that his version was a substitute for the original,
but that it was a glorious supplement. Little as he scrupled to assert
his own merits he could not press this argument to its full extent,
though he was evidently conscious of the truth. He states that as the
old poet was occasionally diffuse, and more often undignified, he had
curtailed the redundancies, and rejected the trivialities. He did not
stop at the easy office of omission. "I dare," he says, "to add that
what beauties I lose in some places I give to others which had them not
originally. If I have altered Chaucer anywhere for the better I must at
the same time acknowledge that I could have done nothing without him.
<i>Facile est inventis addere</i>, is no great commendation, and I am not so
vain to think I have deserved a greater." In dramatic power and pathos,
which are Chaucer's strongest points, Dryden has not improved upon him;
but upon the whole he has narrated the tales in a higher strain of
poetry, in richer and more felicitous language, and with the addition of
many new and happy ideas. A few short examples will show the nature of
the changes he introduced into numerous passages in the process of
recasting them. The Wife of Bath's Tale commences with these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In olde dayes of the King Arthour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which that Britains speken great honour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All was this land fulfill&egrave;d of fairie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elf-queen with her jolly company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Danc&egrave;d full oft in many a greene mead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the old opinion, as I read;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I speak of many hundred year ago;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now can no man see none elves mo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now the greate charity and prayers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of limitours, and other holy freres,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seeken every land, and every stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thick as motes in the sunne-beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessing halls, chambers, kitchenes, and bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cities, and boroughs, castles high, and towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thorpes and barnes, sheepnes, and daieries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That maketh that there be no faieries.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is one of the prettiest pieces of verse in the Canterbury Tales.
Dryden has expanded and excelled it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In days of old when Arthur filled the throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose acts and fame to foreign lands were blown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king of elfs, and little fairy queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gambolled on heaths, and danced on every green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the jolly troop had led the round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grass unbidden rose, and marked the ground:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor darkling did they dance; the silver light              <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ph&oelig;be served to guide their steps aright,            <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with their tripping pleased, prolonged the night.     <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beams they followed where at full she played,          <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor longer than she shed her horns they stayed,            <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence with airy flight to foreign lands conveyed.    <span class="bracket">}</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">More solemnly they kept their sabbaths here,               <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made more spacious rings, and revelled half the year.  <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I speak of ancient times, for now the swain,               <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning late, may pass the woods in vain,                <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never hope to see the nightly train.                   <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Have sprinkled holy water on the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And friars that through the wealthy regions run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resort to farmers rich, and bless their halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exorcise the beds, and cross the walls:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This makes the fairy choirs forsake the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once 'tis hallowed with the rites of grace.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He sometimes carries his innovations further, and the splendour of his
paraphrase entirely eclipses the primitive idea. Chaucer says, in the
tale of the Nun's Priest, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Swevens be but vanities and japes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men dream all day of owles and of apes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eke of many a mase therewithall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men dream of thinges that never be shall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chaucer's hint, which is scarcely more than if the speaker had said in
plain prose, "I have no faith in dreams, for they are wild visions which
never come true," is transformed by Dryden into this exquisite passage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dreams are but interludes, which fancy makes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When monarch-reason sleeps this mimic wakes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compounds a medley of disjointed things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mob of cobblers, and a court of kings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light fumes are merry, grosser fumes are sad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both are the reasonable soul run mad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many monstrous forms in sleep we see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That neither were, nor are, nor e'er can be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes forgotten things long cast behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush forward in the brain, and come to mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nurse's legends are for truths received,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the man dreams but what the boy believed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes we but rehearse a former play;      <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night restores our actions done by day,   <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hounds in sleep will open for their prey.  <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the characteristics of the "poor parson" Chaucer mentions that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was a shepherd, and no mercenary,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which is the only warrant the text afforded for these beautiful lines in
the paraphrase of Dryden:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The prelate for his holy life he prized;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worldly pomp of prelacy despised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Saviour came not with a gaudy show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was his kingdom of the world below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patience in want, and poverty of mind,             <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These marks of church and churchmen he designed,   <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And living taught, and dying left behind.          <span class="bracket">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crown he wore was of the pointed thorn;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They who contend for place and high degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are not his sons, but those of Zebedee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Having gained so much from the masculine and buoyant genius of Dryden,
the newly fashioned tales took their rank as independent works, and were
rather valued for their want of resemblance to Chaucer than because they
were a true reflection of him. There are defects in the modern version.
The language is sometimes too colloquial, and there are many careless
lines; but in the main the verse bounds and dances along with equal
strength, facility, and grace, exhibiting one of the most wonderful
specimens in literature of the power, spirit, and abundance of the
simplest English when moulded by a master. The Flower and the Leaf,
which might have been written in the fairy land it describes, is
pre-eminent above the rest for its bright unceasing flow of delicious
poetry, for its chaste yet luxuriant diction, for its sustained and
various melody, for its lovely pictures both earthly and ethereal, for
its pure, refined, and elevating sentiment.</p>

<p>"By Dryden's Fables," says Johnson, "which had then been not long
published, and were much in the hands of poetical readers, Pope was
tempted to try his own skill in giving Chaucer a more fashionable
appearance, and put January and May, and the Prologue of the Wife of
Bath into modern English." January and May, which the poet says was
translated when he was sixteen or seventeen, was not published till he
was nearly twenty-one, having first appeared on May 2, 1709, in the
sixth volume of Tonson's Miscellany. He imitated Dryden in abridging
Chaucer, but his only addition of any moment to the Merchant's Tale is
in the description of the fairies, which was borrowed from Dryden
himself. His attempt was substantially limited to epitomising the
original in refined language, and musical numbers. In this he succeeded,
and more could not be expected of a youth. If he had aspired higher he
could not at twenty have competed with his mighty predecessor. Dryden's
tales are the productions of a great poetic genius. The January of Pope
is the production of a clever versifier. The relative position which
their respective translations of Chaucer occupy in their works accords
with the difference in their execution. The adaptations of Dryden are
commonly numbered among his choicest effusions. The versions of Pope
hold a subordinate place among his writings, and are hardly taken into
account in the estimate of his powers. The result vindicates the opinion
of Lord Leicester, that in the conversion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> Chaucer into modern
English the loss exceeds the gain. Pope was not insensible to the
dramatic qualities of his author. "I read him still," he said to Spence,
"with as much pleasure as almost any of our poets. He is a master of
manners, of description, and the first tale-teller in the true enlivened
natural way." But in polishing him, something of the nature and
liveliness was inevitably obliterated. He was, in many of his stories,
an admirable novelist in verse, and he adopted a familiar style which
permitted him to relate in rhyme, with the freedom of prose, the common
talk of common men. His traits are in the highest degree colloquial,
individual, and life-like, and his strong strokes are weakened, and his
dramatic vivacity tamed down, when he is turned into smooth, harmonious,
elegant poetry. The refinement in the form is not a compensation for the
sacrifices in the substance, especially when the antique form is itself
essential to teach us how our forefathers spoke, thought, and acted five
hundred years ago. Every touch which renders the picture more modern,
makes it less true. The translation of Pope is skilfully executed, but
it is inferior in raciness and interest to an original which can be read
by any educated Englishman. A few gratuitous defects have been imported
into the modernised January and May. "Chaucer," says Dryden, "followed
nature everywhere, but was never so bold to go beyond her." Pope has
sometimes overstepped the limits. He has here and there exaggerated his
original, and the truth and keeping of the characters are invariably
injured by the change.</p>

<p>"I have confined my choice," said Dryden, "to such tales of Chaucer as
savour nothing of immodesty. If I had desired more to please than to
instruct, the Reeve, the Miller, the Shipman, the Merchant, the Sumner,
and above all the Wife of Bath, in the prologue to her tale, would have
procured me as many friends and readers, as there are beaus and ladies
of pleasure in town. But I will no more offend against good manners. I
am sensible as I ought to be of the scandal I have given by my loose
writings, and make what reparation I am able by this public
acknowledgment." Both the pieces which Pope selected were among the
number which Dryden put under a ban, and the younger poet, perhaps,
considered that when he had purified them from part of their coarseness,
the objection would no longer apply. The apology which Chaucer urged for
his plain speaking was that in telling a tale he must repeat it
correctly, and not surrender truth to delicacy. "Yet if a man," replies
Dryden, "should have enquired of him what need he had of introducing
such characters where obscene words were proper in their mouths, but
very indecent to be heard, I know not what answer he could have made."
None was possible. The offence, nevertheless, was not what Dryden
assumes. The same Chaucer who, in his carefulness to keep to nature,
will have all his <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> talk according to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> rank and
callings, assuredly did not violate nature when he represented the
religious and refined prioress, together with the other high-bred and
decorous members of the party, as willing auditors of the broad and
uncompromising language of their ruder companions. The presence of
ladies and ecclesiastics was not the slightest check upon the tongues of
the pilgrims, and it is evident that in ordinary social life, there was
hardly any limit to the freedom of expression. But in every age a
latitude is allowed in conversation which would be condemned in books,
and Chaucer merely excused himself for recording in poetry the common
colloquial terms of his day. Usage had rendered them inoffensive, and in
themselves they argued no more impurity of thought than the equivalent
circumlocutions of our own generation. The greater or less plainness of
speech which has prevailed at different eras is often rather a question
of manners than of morality. If Pope or Dryden had retained, in this
particular, the phraseology of Chaucer, the adherence to the letter of
the original would have completely falsified its spirit, just as words
which are uttered with innocence by rustics in a cottage would be an
evidence of the utmost depravity when spoken by a man of education in a
drawing-room. The intention influences the effect, and the grossness of
our early writers has not the taint to a reader of the present day which
would attach to similar language when employed by corrupt minds in
civilized times. All the expurgations of Pope were insufficient to make
his version as little exceptionable in the eighteenth century as was the
original of Chaucer to the world of the fourteenth century. A merchant
in the reign of Queen Anne would not have ventured to recite the
modernised story in a mixed company, where ladies like the prioress and
the nuns were present. The tone of the work is even lowered in places.
In the looser literature of Pope's youth, and especially in comedies,
adultery in a wife only furnished food for laughter against the husband.
This is the aspect which is imparted to the translation of January and
May, and it cannot be denied that Chaucer himself in some of his other
stories, is open to the charge of treating vice as a jest. But he did
not fall into the error in the Merchant's Tale, where the supposed
narrator, in accordance with his character, reprobates the criminal
conduct of the treacherous squire and the faithless wife, at the same
time that he exposes the doating folly of the amorous knight.</p>

<span class="i2">We leave them here in this heroic strain,<span class='linenum'>710</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the knight our story turns again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in the garden, with his lovely May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sung merrier than the cuckoo or the jay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was his song; "Oh kind and constant be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Constant and kind I'll ever prove to thee."<span class='linenum'>715</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus singing as he went, at last he drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By easy steps, to where the pear-tree grew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The longing dame looked up, and spied her love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full fairly perched among the boughs above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stopped, and sighing: Oh, good gods, she cried,<span class='linenum'>720</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What pangs, what sudden shoots distend my side?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh for that tempting fruit, so fresh, so green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help, for the love of heav'n's immortal queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help, dearest lord, and save at once the life<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Sore sighed the knight to hear his lady's cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But could not climb, and had no servant nigh:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old as he was, and void of eye-sight too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could, alas! a helpless husband do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And must I languish then, she said, and die,<span class='linenum'>730</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet view the lovely fruit before my eye?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least, kind sir, for charity's sweet sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafe the trunk between your arms to take;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from your back I might ascend the tree;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With all my soul, he thus replied again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd spend my dearest blood to ease thy pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that, his back against the trunk he bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seized a twig, and up the tree she went.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now prove your patience, gentle ladies all!<span class='linenum'>740</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let on me your heavy anger fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis truth I tell, though not in phrase refined,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In that nice moment, lo! the wond'ring knight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked out, and stood restored to sudden sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight on the tree his eager eyes he bent,<span class='linenum'>750</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one whose thoughts were on his spouse intent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when he saw his bosom-wife so dressed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With louder clamours rend the vaulted sky:<span class='linenum'>755</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">What ails my lord? the trembling dame replied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought your patience had been better tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this your love, ungrateful, and unkind,<span class='linenum'>760</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This my reward for having cured the blind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why was I taught to make my husband see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By struggling with a man upon a tree?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I for this the pow'r of magic prove?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Alas, my love! 'tis certain, could you see,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">What I have said, quoth he, I must maintain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The drops; for women, when they list, can cry.<br /></span>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_469" id="Footnote_1_469"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_469"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Pope in this particular has not followed Chaucer. The story
is told by the merchant, who announces in the prologue, that he has been
two months married, and that in this brief space he has endured more
misery from the fiendishness of his wife than a bachelor could undergo
in an entire lifetime from the enmity of the world. He lays it down for
a general maxim, that
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We wedded men live in sorwe and care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assay it whoso will, and he shall find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I say sooth, by Saint Thomas of Inde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for the more part; I say not all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God shielde that it shoulde so befall.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The host begs that since the merchant knows so much of the trials of
matrimony, he will instruct the company in some of them.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gladly, quoth he, but of mine owne sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sorry heart I telle may no more.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
He accordingly relates the adventures of January and May in illustration
of the misfortunes of the wedded state, and commences with the panegyric
of January upon its unmixed blessings. The merchant then adds,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus said this olde knight that was so wise,<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
which is an ironical comment on what the narrator of the tale considers
a delusive dream, and a proof of the credulous folly of the speaker. The
idea of ascribing genuine sense and wisdom to the knight,
notwithstanding that he was weak enough, at the age of sixty, to marry a
girl, is confined to the version of Pope, and is not in itself
unnatural; but the character, upon the whole, is better preserved in
Chaucer, since the entire talk and conduct of January indicate a feeble
mind.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_470" id="Footnote_2_470"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_470"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> "Courage" in the original is not used in the modern sense,
but signifies a hearty desire.</p></div>

<span class="i0">That day and night he doth all that he can<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_472" id="Footnote_4_472"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_472"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In the original,

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And certainly, as sooth as God is king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take a wife it is a glorious thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And namely when a man is old and hoar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then is a wife the fruit of his tresor.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
This is another instance that the merchant's remarks are sarcastic; for
no rational person would gravely assert that to wed was especially wise
in old age, when a man was married for his money alone. The whole
purport of the tale was to prove that such an alliance ended in
discomfiture. The vein of satire is continued through the subsequent
reflections. The merchant represents January as imagining wives to be
models of obedience and fidelity, who will cleave to a husband through
weal and woe, and will never be weary of loving and serving him, though
he is bed-ridden all his days. The example of May, to which the
description is a preface, shows that the praises are meant to be
interpreted in an adverse sense.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_473" id="Footnote_5_473"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_473"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In the original the merchant is quoting an invective
against wives from the Liber Aureolus of Theophrastus, who had long been
dead. Hence the narrator calls down a curse upon his <i>bones</i> in the name
of the advocates of matrimony:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This entent and an hundred sithe worse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Writeth this man; there God his bones curse.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"Sithe" signifies "times." Pope has generalised the imprecation, and
extended it to all bards, living or deceased, whereby the fitness of
invoking a curse upon their bones is destroyed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_474" id="Footnote_6_474"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_474"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Chaucer would have thought it an anomaly for a Christian
knight to invoke the heathen deities. The original is,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A wife! ah! Sainte Mary, <i>benedicite</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How might a man have any adversite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath a wife? certes I cannot say.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The requirements of the metre in this and other passages of Chaucer,
show that <i>benedicite</i> was sometimes contracted, in the pronunciation,
to <i>ben'cite</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_475" id="Footnote_7_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_475"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The merchant, in his account of the motives which actuated
the knight, dilates more largely in the original, and in more
enthusiastic language, upon the felicity of marriage. A wife helps her
husband in his work, is the careful guardian of his property, and is
perfect in her submission.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She saith nought ones nay when he saith ye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do this, saith he; all ready, sir, saith she.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Consequently the married man
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upon his bare knees ought all his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thanken his God that him hath sent a wife;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
and if he is not yet possessed of the treasure, he ought to pray without
ceasing that it may be vouchsafed him, for then he is established in
safety, and
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">May not be deceived as I guess.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
From the praise of wives, the merchant, speaking the views of the
knight, proceeds to extol the trustworthy advice of women in general,
and his first instance is Rebecca, who instructed Jacob how to supplant
Esau. The reasoning is purposely rendered inconsistent, and the
assertion that a married man was secured against deception is
immediately followed by an example in which the husband was deluded by
the stratagem of the wife.</p></div>

<span class="i0">Saved her husband Nabal, when that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should have been slain.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The respite that Abigail obtained for Nabal was very short. He died by a
judgment from heaven in about ten days from the time that she went forth
to meet David, and with presents and persuasions diverted him from his
purpose, as he was advancing to take vengeance on her husband. The
striking narrative in the apocryphal book of Judith is undoubtedly
fabulous. The pretended Judith was a widow. The deceptions by which she
is said to have got the captain of the Assyrian army into her power are
abhorrent to our purer morality, but they would have been considered
legitimate stratagems of war in the East.</p></div>

for him because many heads are wiser than one, but because with several
people on the look out there is more likelihood that a suitable wife
will be found quickly than if he was unassisted in the search.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_479" id="Footnote_11_479"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_479"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> In the original,

<span class="i0">But one thing warn I you, my friendes dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will none old wife have in no manere.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Marriages seem to have taken place in those days at a very early age.
The wife of Bath married at twelve, and the knight's notion of an "old
wife" it appears, five lines further on, was a woman of twenty. He
insists that he will marry nobody that is above sixteen:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She shall not passe sixteene year certain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old fish, and young flesh, that would I have full fain.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And bet than old beef is the tender veal.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"Bet" is for "better."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_480" id="Footnote_12_480"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_480"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Chaucer's knight assigns it as a motive to wedlock that he
may have

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Children to thonour of God above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not only for paramour, and for love.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
But a little before he had given a more worldly reason for his desire to
have a son and heir, and said that he would rather be eaten by dogs than
that his inheritance should go to a stranger.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_481" id="Footnote_13_481"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_481"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The flippancy of this couplet, which departs from the
original, is at variance with the tone of the knight, whose speech
commenced with the words,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">Friendes I am hoar and old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And almost, God wot, at my pittes brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my soule somewhat must I think.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have my body folily dispended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed be God that it shall be amended.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
In the passage, for which Pope's lines are the substitute, the knight is
enumerating the causes why men should marry, and one reason, he says, is
that each person ought to
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">Helpen other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In meschief, as a sister shall the brother,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, sires, by your leave that am not I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, God be thank&egrave;d, I dare make avaunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel my limbes stark and suffisaunt.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The meaning is, that when a husband is "in meschief," or, in other
words, in a state of helpless decrepitude, his wife ought to live in
holy chastity, and nurse him as a sister would a brother. But, adds the
knight, thank God I am not decrepit myself, and feel my limbs to be
still stout; which is a very different sentiment from sneering at the
saintly life he had just commended.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_482" id="Footnote_14_482"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_482"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> This verse, which has no counterpart in the original, is

the original. He summons his friends to hear his fixed resolution, and
to beg their assistance. He wants no advice, and instead of inviting
them to speak their minds with freedom, he concludes his address with
the words
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And synnes ye have heard all mine intent,<br /></span>

They do, indeed, offer him counsel where he solicited help, which is a
true stroke of nature on both sides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_484" id="Footnote_16_484"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_484"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Pope gives the real character of Placebo, but sets
probability at defiance in making him parade with boastful effrontery
his own systematic fawning and flattery. Chaucer has not committed the
extravagance. With him Placebo justifies his assentation on the ground
that lords are better informed than their inferiors.

again inconsistant with the tenor of Chaucer's narrative. The knight had
notoriously been a dissolute man, and the coarse reflection would be out
of place when the avowed object of his projected marriage was that he
might live more soberly than he had hitherto done.</p></div>

wise, sober or given to drink, proud or in any other respect unamiable,

of January that he was determined not to wait.</p></div>

newly married wives to keep their chambers till the fourth day, and he
repeats the fact here:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_506" id="Footnote_38_506"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_506"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> In the original January passes a warm panegyric upon the
excellent qualities of Damian, which is meant to display in broader
contrast the treachery and infamy of the squire. The merchant in his own
person denounces the villany of Damian's conduct, and prays that all
persons may be protected from the machinations of those deceitful
vipers, who, when fostered in a family, employ their opportunities to
injure their benefactors. Pope has omitted every allusion of the kind,
and has treated the baseness of the squire as if he regarded it in the
light of a joke.</p></div>

desire, she paid to Damian in his chamber, that she might cheer him in

fairy race of Shakespeare and Milton. Chaucer has king Pluto and his
queen Proserpina.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span>
</p><p>
There was not much judgment required. They are fairies in Chaucer, but,
as was not unusual in his day, he called them by names taken from the
heathen mythology. Pope merely dropped the classical appellations, which
would have been an incongruity when he wrote. In the details of his
description he did not copy Shakespeare or Milton, but Dryden's version
of Chaucer's Wife of Bath:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_515" id="Footnote_47_515"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_515"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> There is a natural trait in the original which is not

<span class="i0">He patiently took his adversitie.<br /></span>

This is one of the deeper and more solemn touches which Pope
systematically rejected. Although the old man gets reconciled to the
loss of his sight, his jealousy remains unabated.</p></div>

makes the knight express his belief to May that she is more likely to be
kept faithful by her love of money than by her sense of honour and
religion. It is undeniable that covetousness would be the predominant
motive with a depraved woman, such as was poor old January's wife, but
this is not his settled conviction, and he would have shrunk from openly
admitting the idea.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_521" id="Footnote_53_521"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_521"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The knight's promise was to be performed the next morning.
His doubt was whether May, on her side, would fulfil the pledge of
perpetual fidelity. The ceremony is, therefore, reversed in the
original, and January asks <i>her</i> to kiss <i>him</i> in token of her adhesion
to the covenant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_522" id="Footnote_54_522"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_522"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> In the original the knight avows the jealousy, which in
Pope's version he denies, and excuses his misgivings on the ground of
May's beauty, and his own age. Having disclaimed all jealousy, there is
no longer any meaning in representing him as pleading the inequality of
his years to justify his conduct.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_523" id="Footnote_55_523"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_523"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> May in the original is the same wicked, shameless woman
that she is described by Pope, but Chaucer is content to put into her
mouth the wish that she may die a foul death if she breaks her marriage
vows. There is not a hint of the more frightful imprecation she invokes
on herself in expressing the hope that she may descend alive into hell
when she commits the crime she is meditating at the moment.</p></div>

<h2>THE WIFE OF BATH.</h2>

<h2>HER PROLOGUE.</h2>


<h3>FROM CHAUCER.</h3>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>The Wife of Bath is the other piece of Chaucer which Pope selected to
imitate. One cannot but wonder at his choice, which perhaps nothing but
his youth could excuse. Dryden, who is known not to be nicely
scrupulous, informs us, that he would not versify it on account of its
indecency. Pope, however, has omitted or softened the grosser and more
offensive passages. Chaucer afforded him many subjects of a more sublime
and serious species; and it were to be wished Pope had exercised his
pencil on the pathetic story of the patience of Griselda, or Troilus and
Cressida, or the complaint of the Black Knight; or, above all, on
Cambuscan and Canace. From the accidental circumstance of Dryden and
Pope having copied the gay and ludicrous parts of Chaucer, the common
notion seems to have arisen, that Chaucer's vein of poetry was chiefly
turned to the light and the ridiculous. But they who look into Chaucer
will soon be convinced of this prevailing prejudice, and will find his
comic vein, like that of Shakespeare, to be only like one of mercury,
imperceptibly mingled with a mine of gold. Mr. Hughes withdrew his
contributions to a volume of Miscellaneous Poems, published by Steele,
because this Prologue was to be inserted in it, which he thought too
obscene for the gravity of his character. "The extraordinary length,"
says Mr. Tyrwhitt, "of the Wife of Bath's Prologue, as well as the vein
of pleasantry that runs through it, is very suitable to the character of
the speaker. The greatest part must have been of Chaucer's own
invention, though one may plainly see that he had been reading the
popular invectives against marriage, and women in general, such as the
Roman de la Rose, Valerius ad Rufinum de non ducend&acirc; uxore, and
particularly Hieronymus contra Jovinianum. The holy Father, by way of
recommending celibacy, has exerted all his learning and eloquence, and
he certainly was not deficient in either, to collect together and
aggravate whatever he could find to the prejudice of the female sex.
Among other things he has inserted his own translation (probably) of a
long extract from what he calls, Liber Aureolus Theophrasti de Nuptiis.
Next to him in order of time was the treatise entitled, Epistola Valerii
ad Rufinum de non ducend&acirc; uxore. It has been printed, for the similarity
of its sentiments I suppose, among the works of St. Jerome, though it is
evidently of a much later date. Tanner, from Wood's MSS. Collection,
attributes it to Walter Mapes. I should not believe it to be older; as
John of Salisbury, who has treated of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> the same subject in his Polycrat.
l. viii. c. xl. does not appear to have seen it. To these two books Jean
de Meun has been obliged for some of the severest strokes in his Roman
de la Rose; and Chaucer has transfused the quintessence of all the three
works upon the subject of matrimony, into his Wife of Bath's Prologue
and Merchant's Tale."</p>

<p>The lines of Pope in the piece before us are spirited and easy and have,
properly enough, a free colloquial air. The tale, to which this is the
prologue, has been versified by Dryden, and is supposed to have been of
Chaucer's own invention; as is the exquisite vision of the Flower and
the Leaf, which has received a thousand new graces from the spirited and
harmonious Dryden. It is to his Fables, (next to his Music Ode,) written
when he was above seventy years old, that Dryden will chiefly owe his
immortality; and among these, particularly to the well-conducted tale of
Palamon and Arcite, the pathetic picture of Sigismunda, the wild and
terrible graces of Theodore and Honoria, and the sportive pleasantry of
Cymon and Iphigenia. The warmth and melody of these pieces has never
been excelled in our language; I mean in rhyme. It is mortifying and
surprising to see the cold and contemptuous manner in which Dr. Johnson
speaks of these capital pieces, which he says "require little criticism,
and seem hardly worth the rejuvenescence, as he affectedly calls it,
which Dryden has bestowed upon them." It is remarkable, that in his
criticisms he has not even mentioned the Flower and Leaf.</p>

<p>These pieces of Chaucer were not the only ones that were versified by
Pope. Mr. Harte assured me, that he was convinced by some circumstances
which Fenton, his friend, communicated to him, that Pope wrote the
characters, that make the introduction to the Canterbury Tales,
published under the name of Betterton.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Warton thinks, "one cannot but wonder at Pope's choice from Chaucer
of these stories, when so many more are to be found in him more
poetical." His observation on Chaucer's poems is very just, but the fact
is, Pope by this very selection showed the bent of his mind,&mdash;that it
was rather turned to satire and ridicule, than to the more elevated
strains of poetry.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>The imitations of Chaucer's January and May, and Wife of Bath's
Prologue, are executed with a degree of freedom, ease, and spirit, and
at the same time with a judgment and delicacy which not only far exceeds
what might have been expected from so young a writer, but which leave
nothing to be wished for in the mind of the reader. The humour of
Chaucer is translated into the lines of Pope, almost without suffering
any evaporation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Roscoe.</span></p>

<p>Pope's version of the Prologue of the Wife of Bath first appeared in a
volume of Poetical Miscellanies, published by Steele, in 1714.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> The
portrait of this repulsive woman is drawn by Chaucer with a vigorous
hand. She is a wealthy cloth manufacturer, with a bold countenance, and
more than masculine freedom of speech. She dresses ostentatiously, rides
with spurs, and, glorying in her shame, openly boasts of the vices which
less impudent women would carefully conceal. Her two predominant
characteristics are an inordinate self-will which makes her resolve to
rule her husbands with an absolute despotism, and an inordinate
sensuality which has completely absorbed every finer sentiment. She not
only avows her propensities, but exults in the deceit, the tricks, and
the violence which she has employed to gratify them as so many
testimonies to her cleverness and power. She has no compunctious
visitings for the frauds she has practised, and the misery she has
inflicted upon her deceased husbands. She speaks of the dead as of the
living with brutal insensibility, and would think it a weakness to be
swayed by a human feeling. The impersonation of domineering, heartless
selfishness, her pride is to prevail by tyranny instead of by the gentle
graces of feminine tenderness, and her pleasure is to indulge in worldly
gaiety, and the gross gratifications of sense. Even her jovial good
humour is hardly a redeeming feature in her character, for it mainly
proceeds from her keen relish for physical enjoyments, and turns to
temper the instant she is thwarted. It is difficult to conceive that
anybody could be injured by reading her confessions, which have nothing
alluring, but with Warton, we must condemn the taste which could select
the story as a ground-work for the embellishments of modern verse. The
character may exist in every generation. The unblushing candour with
which it displays itself belonged to more outspoken times than our own.
Chaucer painted from the life, and this portrait of a coarse,
voluptuous, defiant woman of the citizen class, finds a place in his
gallery, because she had a prominent place in the society of the middle
ages. There was no rational motive for tricking her out in the newest
fashion of a period to which she did not belong, and she might with
advantage have been allowed to remain in her primitive place and garb.
The indelicacy of the pieces he translated from Chaucer was, however,
one of their recommendations to Pope, and they may have had a further
attraction for him from the fact, that they held wives up to odium. His
deformed and insignificant person was an antidote to love, and the court
he paid to women met with a cold return. He retaliated with his pen for
the mortification to which they exposed him, and he almost always
represented them in a frivolous or degrading light. He may not
improbably have had a pleasure in reproducing from Chaucer the caustic
sentiments which were congenial to his own, and may have found some
satisfaction for his wounded spirit in revenging indifference by
satire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Warton says that Pope has softened the more offensive passages in the
Wife of Bath's Prologue, but his version, on the other hand, is often
less decorous than the original. He has not justified his choice of the
subject by his skill in the treatment of it. The adaptation is much
inferior to the companion piece of January and May, and appears to have
been thrown off in haste. There are a few, a very few, happy lines and
expressions, but the bulk of the versification is not much above
mediocrity, and is frequently below it. He has failed in the substance
still more than in the form. Roscoe was of opinion that the humour of
Chaucer had hardly suffered any evaporation. The admirers of the
original have arrived at a different conclusion, and have contended,
with almost one voice, that hardly any of the humour has been preserved.
The genuine Prologue is alive with manners, passions, idiomatic
conversations, and natural incidents. The copy is by comparison a dead,
insipid dissertation. The mode in which Pope has abridged the narrative
is one of many proofs that he only cared for characters in their broad
outline, and had either no perception of the subtler workings of the
mind, or no appreciation of them. If ever a reader masters the full
sense of an author it must be when he translates him, and yet Pope has
overlooked or rejected many of the happiest traits in Chaucer, and has
falsified others, to the invariable injury of the story, and sometimes
with a total disregard to consistency. Particular deficiencies are of
little moment in the midst of general excellence, but in the present
instance there is nothing to redeem the blots, and the narrative from
first to last is a pale and feeble reflection of the original.</p>

<p>Warton asserts, on the authority of Harte, that Fenton believed that the
version of the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales, which appeared in
Lintot's Miscellany under the name of Betterton, was the work of Pope,
and Johnson adds that "Fenton made Pope a gay offer of five pounds if he
would show the characters in Betterton's hand." The celebrated actor
certainly left some literary papers behind him, if we may assume that a
letter from Caryll to Pope, and which was published by the poet himself,
is a genuine production. "I am very glad," Caryll writes, May 23, 1712,
"for the sake of the widow, and for the credit of the deceased, that
Betterton's remains are fallen into such hands, as may render them
reputable to the one, and beneficial to the other." In a note Pope
states that the remains were the modernised portions of Chaucer
contained in the Miscellany of Lintot. There was no apparent motive for
deception on the subject, and the internal evidence supports the
conclusion that Betterton composed the translation, and that Pope merely
revised it. It is a bald, worthless production, with a few lines or
couplets which seem to have proceeded from a more practised versifier
than the novice who put together the bulk of the work. The choicest
parts are very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> little better than bad; for Pope was a provident poet,
and he did not decorate Betterton with feathers which would have shone
with lustre in his own plumage. The great actor, on his side, has
signally failed in the point where his art might have been expected to
teach him better. He who had such a deep insight into the characters he
personated, and who gave voice, action, and gesture to all the passions
with such fidelity and power, has pared away the dramatic vivacity of
Chaucer and left only a vapid, hybrid compound which is neither modern
nor medi&aelig;val. The sketch of the good parson is omitted altogether,
doubtless because Dryden had already tried his hand upon it, and it was
thought imprudent to provoke a comparison with his masterly paraphrase.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_536" id="Footnote_1_536"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_536"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Pope has departed at the outset from the conception of
Chaucer. The purpose of the tale which the wife of Bath tells is to show
that women love, above all things, to govern; and her personal history,
which she relates in the prologue, is an account of the means by which
she reduced her husbands to submission. It was not her own matrimonial
woes, which had been slight enough, that she was about to set forth, but
the miseries of those whom it is her boast to have worried into
obedience to her will. As Pope correctly renders the original, she
states that the pains referred to the smart she had inflicted on her
husbands; and, far from alleging that "dear-bought wisdom" had taught
her that matrimony to a woman was a life of suffering, she thanks God
that she has been married five times already, and declares that directly
her fifth mate is dead, she will marry a sixth.

<span class="i0">Beside a welle Jesus, God and man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake in reproof of the Samaritan:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou hast i-had five husbandes," quoth he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And that ilk-man, which that now hath thee<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What that he meant thereby I cannot sayn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that I axe why the fithe man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not husband to the Samaritan?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The question is addressed to those who deny the validity of second
marriages, and she asks them to explain upon their theory why the fifth
man was not properly the husband of the Samaritan woman, when there is
the authoritative declaration of Scripture that he was.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_539" id="Footnote_4_539"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_539"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Pope alone is responsible for the second half of this line,
which in its present application has an unbecoming levity. There was a
pardoner in the company, a person who got his living by selling
indulgences, and by displaying the pretended relics of saints, who says
that he was about to marry, but that he shall abandon his intention now
that he learns what despotic authority wives exercise over husbands. The
wife of Bath, unabashed, informs him that what she has told is nothing
in comparison with that which is to follow:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Abide, quoth she, my tale is not begun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, thou shalt drinke of another tun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere that I go, shall savour worse than ale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when that I have told thee forth my tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tribulation in marriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which I am expert in all my age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is to say, myself hath been the whip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then might thou choose whether thou wilt sip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thilke tunne that I shall abroach:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beware of it ere thou too nigh approach.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
These dramatic touches omitted by Pope give life to the piece, and
individuality to the characters.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_540" id="Footnote_5_540"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_540"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In the original,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I shall say sooth of husbands that I had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As three of them were good, and two were bad.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
She meant that the two were rebellious in comparison with the three who
were her slaves; for in speaking of the entire five, at the commencement
of the prologue, she added,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all were worthy men in their degree.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Pope has fallen into an inconsistency. He states that the three old
husbands were those who "were just tolerable." Yet when he comes to
describe the youngest of the two, whom he here calls "bad," he makes the
wife of Bath exclaim,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now for my fifth loved lord, the last and <i>best</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
In Chaucer she distinctly denies that he was the best, but says she
<i>loved</i> him best, and proceeds to explain the reason, which is that
women always value those most who treat them with harshness or
indifference.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_541" id="Footnote_6_541"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_541"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This trait in the wife of Bath's character is brought out
more distinctly by Chaucer:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Me needeth not no longer doon diligence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win their love, or do them reverence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They loved me so well, high God above!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I tolde no deynte of their love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wise woman will busy her ever in one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gete her love, there she hath none.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But synnes I had them wholly in my hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And synnes they had me given all their land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should I take keep them for to please<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it were for my profit or mine ease?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"I tolde no deynte of their love," means I set no store by it; "ever in
one" is always; and "take keep" is take care.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_542" id="Footnote_7_542"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_542"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The wife of Bath's first lesson in the art of domestic
government is a panegyric upon the advantages of sturdy lying, in which
Pope has not gone beyond the original:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye wise wives that can understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus should ye speak, and bear them wrong in hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For half so boldely can there no man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swere and lie as a woman can.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"To bear them wrong in hand" is to affirm wrongfully or falsely. The
phrase "to bear in hand" for "to asseverate," was still frequently used
in the reign of Charles II.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_543" id="Footnote_8_543"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_543"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The wife of Bath accuses her old husbands to their faces of
having delivered this kind of railing lecture to her when they had come
home at night "as drunk as mice." The drunkenness and the railing are
alike inventions of her own, but she appeals to her niece, and Jenkin,
the apprentice, to bear witness to the truth of her assertions. The
version of Pope is not so vivid, so lively, or so close to nature as the
original, and he has nearly passed over one of the most prominent
characteristics of the speech. When the wife of Bath taunts her husband
with the reproaches she pretended he had heaped upon her, she
intersperses her repetition of his objurgations with abusive and
disdainful names by way of comment upon his monstrous sentiments. Old
caynard or villain, Sir old lecher, thou very knave, lorel or worthless
fellow, old dotard schrewe or sinner, old barrel full of lies, Sir old
fool, are some of the appellations by which she marks her opinion of the
doctrines she fathers upon him. After reciting his alleged complaint,
that women concealed their vices till they were married, she adds that
the maxim is worthy of "a schrewe," or scoundrel. When she imputes to
him the declaration that no man would wed who was wise, or who desired
to go to heaven, she follows it up with the wish that thunder and
lightning would break his wicked neck. When he is charged with having
said that there were three things that troubled earth, and that a wife
was one of them, she hopes that the life of such a villain will be cut
short. When she taxes him with quoting the proverb that a house not
water-tight, a smoky chimney, and a scolding wife drove men from home,
she retorts upon him that he is himself a scold, and intimates that his
years are an aggravation of the vice. This is not only natural as the
sort of scurrilous language which the wife of Bath would have used if
the drunken invectives had been real, but was part of her plan for
bringing her husbands into subjection. Her indignant recriminations were
intended to browbeat them into meekness.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_544" id="Footnote_9_544"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_544"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> She enlarges in the original upon this device, which was
one of her capital resources. She quotes the proverb, that he first
grinds who comes first to the mill, and upon this principle, when she
had done wrong, she began by attacking her husband;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or elles I had often time been spilt.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The poor man thus suddenly assailed stood upon the defensive,
endeavoured to vindicate his innocence, and was heartily glad to hold
his tongue on condition of receiving forgiveness for faults he had never
committed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_545" id="Footnote_10_545"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_545"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> By pretending that she went out to watch her husbands she
got the opportunity for indulging in freaks and jollity with her
youthful friends.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Under that colour had I many a mirth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all such wit is given us of birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deceipt, weeping, spinning, God hath give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To women kindely while they may live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus of one thing I avaunte me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At th' end I had the bet in each degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sleight or force, or of some maner thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by continual murmur or chiding.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"Kindely" is by nature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_546" id="Footnote_11_546"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_546"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> In the original,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With empty hand men may no hawkes lure.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
When the falconer had let fly his hawks, and wanted them to return, he
was commonly obliged to entice them by some bait. The tassel, or tercel,
was the male of the peregrine falcon, and was noted for its docility and
gentleness. It would seem as if this species would obey the summons of
the trainer without any other inducement, for when Juliet calls after
Romeo, and he does not instantly reappear, she says,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">O for a falconer's voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lure this tassel-gentle back again.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_547" id="Footnote_12_547"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_547"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> In Chaucer she states that her husbands would grant all
her demands to soothe her into good humour:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That made me that ever I would them chide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though the pope had seten them beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I nold not spare them at their owne board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, by my troth, I quit them word for word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As help me very God omnipotent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I right now should make my testament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I owe them nought a word, that it nis quit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I brought it so aboute by my wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they must give it up, as for the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or elles had we never been in rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though he looked as a grim lion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet should he fail of his conclusion.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Pope has omitted the latter half of the lines and thus obliterated one
of those nicer traits of nature with which the original abounds. Men put
on the grimness of the lion, and think to prevail by strength, but women
conquer by pertinacity. The majority of men grow weary of perpetual
conflict, and purchase peace by concession; but women of the stamp of
the wife of Bath wilt wrangle for ever, and prefer endless discord to
the subjugation of self-will. Dryden, adding to Virgil's thought, has
expressed the idea, &AElig;n. v. 1024:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife,<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_548" id="Footnote_13_548"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_548"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Chaucer represents her as still youthful:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I was young, and full of ragerie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stubborn and strong and jolly as a pye.<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_550" id="Footnote_15_550"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_550"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> In the original she does not say that she set his marrow
frying, but that she fried him in his own grease, by stirring up in him
the tormenting jealousy which his faithlessness had first engendered in
herself.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I made him of the same wood a cross.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not of my body in no foul manere;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There was no wight save God and he that wist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many wyse how sore I him twist.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
This is a life-like portrait of a man tortured by inward pangs, and
affecting an air of indifference while he did not dare to complain, from
the consciousness that his greater offence would expose him to a
crushing retort.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_551" id="Footnote_16_551"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_551"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> In the character which Chaucer gives of the wife of Bath
he says,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thrice had she been at Jerusalem;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hadde passed many a strange stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Rome she hadde been, and at Boulogne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Galice at Saint Jame, and at Cologne.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The reputed tomb of Saint James was at Compostella, in Galicia, and was
a favourite resort of pilgrims. The wife of Bath may be supposed to have
joined these expeditions quite as much from a love of roving and novelty
as from superstitious motives.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_552" id="Footnote_17_552"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_552"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Chaucer says he was buried under the rood-beam, or as it
is usually called the rood-loft, which was placed on the top of the
screen that separated the chancel from the nave. The name was derived
from the rood or cross that stood in the centre with the effigy of our
crucified Lord, and having on one side an image of the Virgin, and on
the other of the apostle John. Pope buries the deceased husband in the
churchyard, and the root is a wooden cross which has been erected upon
his grave.</p></div>

of her husband, 352 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, she erected a monument to him at
Halicarnassus, which, from the beauty of its architecture and sculpture,
was considered one of the seven wonders of the world. The Romans, says
Pausanias, called all their most magnificent tombs <i>mausolea</i> after this
monument to Mausolua, and hence our modern term mausoleum. There is no
mention of the tomb of Mausolus in Chaucer.</p></div>

<span class="i0">In this matter a queynte fantasy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wayte, what thing we may not lightly have,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With danger outen alle we our ware;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great press at market maketh dear chaffare.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"Daungerous" in the second line means sparing, and in the last line but
one, "with danger" signifies with a scarcity. Then, says the wife of
Bath, we must produce all our own wares to give in exchange. At the date
of her fifth marriage she was forty and the bridegroom was only twenty.
Everything is now reversed. Her first husbands had endowed her with all
their property that they might buy a young wife in their old age. She,
in turn, that she may procure a young husband, gives him
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">all the land and fee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever was me give therebefore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But afterward repented me full sore.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Her aged mates had worshipped her, and she repaid them with disdain. In
her mature years she is infatuated by a youth, and he, who has no relish
for the homage of a matron of forty, slights her just as she had done
her early husbands under similar circumstances.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_555" id="Footnote_20_555"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_555"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> It would seem from Chaucer that the youth was a native of
Bath, and had returned there when he had completed his education at
Oxford:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He some time was a clerk of Oxenford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had left school, and went at home to board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my gossib, duelling in our town:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God have her soul, her name was Alisoun.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"My gossib" is my godmother, and the wife of Bath, whose christian name
was also Alisoun, had been named after her. Pope, by turning "<i>my</i>
gossip" into "<i>a</i> gossip," has done away with the special relationship,
and employed the word in its modern sense of a lover of tittle-tattle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_556" id="Footnote_21_556"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_556"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> In Chaucer she adds a more powerful motive:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">what wist I where my grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was shapen for to be, or in what place?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
In other words, as she explains shortly afterwards, she was in search of
a lover who might succeed the fourth husband whenever he died.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_557" id="Footnote_22_557"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_557"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> "To perform a station," says Richelet, in his French
Dictionary, "consists in visiting with devotion one or several churches
a certain number of days and times, and praying there in order to
propitiate the wrath of God, and obtain some favour from his mercy." The
wife of Bath in the original says, that she attended vigils,
processions, preachings, miracle-plays, and marriages, besides making
pilgrimages, but "stations" are not included in her list. The Roman
Catholicism of Pope had rendered the word familiar to him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_558" id="Footnote_23_558"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_558"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The expression "I can't tell how" implies that the
intimacy on the part of the wife of Bath was accidental, whereas it
appears from Pope's context, and still more from the original, that it
was a deliberate design:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now will I telle forth what happed me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say that in the fieldes walked we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till truely we had such dalliance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This clerk and I, that of my purveyance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spake to him, and saide how that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I were widdow, shoulde wedde me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For certainly I say for no bobaunce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet was I never withouten purveyance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mariage, ne or no thinges eke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hold a mouse's heart not worth a leek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath but oon hole to sterte to,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if that faile then is all i-do.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The acknowledgment that while married to one man she is always engaged
to a second, seems to the wife of Bath to have nothing discreditable in
it, and she only fears lest she should expose herself to the charge of
vanity in asserting that she can command a succession of admirers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_559" id="Footnote_24_559"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_559"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> No Englishwoman would talk of laying her husband in his
urn, not to mention that the phrase is a mixture of incongruous ideas,
the "laid" being applicable to burial, and the "urn" to burning. When
the wife of Bath speaks of her departed husband she says,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He is now in his grave and in his chest.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_560" id="Footnote_25_560"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_560"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> This couplet is an exaggeration of the original:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">I followed ay my dames lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well of that as of other thinges more.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_561" id="Footnote_26_561"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_561"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Tearing garments, and throwing dust upon the head was a
custom with some ancient nations, but was not an English habit, and
there is no allusion to it in the text of Chaucer:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">When that my fourthe husband was on bier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wept algate, and made a sorry cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As wives musten for it is usage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with my kerchief covered my visage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, for that I was purveyed of a mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wept but small, and that I undertake.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The hard-hearted selfishness which does not bestow a thought upon the
dead, being solely intent upon enjoying existence with the living, comes
out in a yet more odious light when she narrates her feelings at the
funeral. Her mind is entirely taken up with the young clerk, and mainly
with admiration of his figure:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">When that I saw him go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the bier, methought he had a pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of legges and of feet so clean and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all my heart I gave unto his hold.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_562" id="Footnote_27_562"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_562"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> She does not in the original profess "to repent it still,"
and for the excellent reason that, after a period of rebellion on the
part of the clerk, he had become a puppet in her hands, and had rendered
up both himself and his chattels to her undisputed management.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_563" id="Footnote_28_563"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_563"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> The wife of Bath says she insisted upon going from house
to house, according to her former custom, and the clerk set his face
against the practice. His instances from Roman story were directed
against this special failing, and were not general declamations on the
virtue of Roman matrons and Gracchus' mother. The clerk told the
gossiping, intriguing dame that Simplicius Gallus left his wife for
ever, merely because he caught her looking out of the door with her head
uncovered. He told her of another Roman that in the same manner deserted
his wife because she one day went to see a game without his knowledge.
His quotation from Holy Writ is not "some grave sentence," but the
particular sentence of Ecclesiasticus which says, "Give the water no
passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad." When the context
has been generalised the lines which follow have not the accumulative
sting of the original, where they are an additional example of the evil
consequences of suffering women to rove about. Pope has further weakened
their force by supposing them to have no higher authority than the
opinion of the clerk. In Chaucer they are given as a proverb, and the
husband urges them with triumph because they convey the general
experience of mankind. The language is stronger than in Pope. Instead of
mildly pronouncing that the man who suffers his wife to visit "halwes"
or the shrines of saints "deserves a fool's cap," the proverb declares
that he "is worthy to be hanged on the galwes."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_564" id="Footnote_29_564"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_564"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The clerk in the original reads with greater assiduity
than "oft at evening."
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He had a book that gladly night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his desport he woulde read alway.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
After describing the contents of the book the wife of Bath adds,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And alle these were bound in one volume;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every night and day was his custume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he had leisure and vacatioun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From other worldes occupation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reden in this book of wicked wives.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
This portion of the narrative in Chaucer is exceedingly pleasant and
natural. The wife says that she paid no regard to the clerk's Roman
precedents, his quotations from Scripture, his old saws and proverbs.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ne I would not of him corrected be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hate him that my vices telleth me.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The contempt with which she treated his exhortations drove him utterly
mad, and it was then that he betook himself to reading all the
literature he could find that bore upon the vices and frailties of
women. The evidence of their general perversity with which his studies
supplied him consoled him for the ungovernable disposition of his own
wife, and he used "to laugh away full fast" over the record of their
obstinacy and evil doings. He had the sweeter satisfaction of revenge.
His mirth galled his imperious, froward wife, and when he read aloud the
endless detail of female iniquities, backed up by the authority of great
names, she could restrain her rage no longer, and the storm burst forth
under which the wretched clerk succumbed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_565" id="Footnote_30_565"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_565"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Pope has omitted a stroke of humour; for in the original,
she naturally mistakes the rank and age of St. Jerome.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And eke there was a clerk sometime in Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A <i>cardinal,</i> that highten St. Jerome.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span><br /></span>

popular in the days of Chaucer.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
Warton takes no account of the fact that Chaucer was only enumerating
the authors which furnished arguments against women. Valerius is a tract
by Walter Mapes, which bears the title "Epistola Valerii ad Rufinum."
St. Jerome's denunciations of matrimony are in his treatise "Contra
Jovinianum." Tertullian wrote strongly against second marriages; and
severe animadversions upon female vices or weaknesses have a large place
in his works. "Who is meant by Chrysippus," says Tyrwhitt, "I cannot
guess." Ovid's Art of Love, and the Letters of Eloisa and Abelard are
known by name to all the world.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_567" id="Footnote_32_567"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_567"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> This line is not in Chaucer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_569" id="Footnote_34_569"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_569"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> The wife of Bath, having laid down the maxim that it is
impossible for any clerk to speak well of women, except it be of the
saints, indignantly inquires,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who painted the lion, tell me, who?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
and with an oath she adds,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">If women hadde written stories,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As clerkes have within their oratories,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would have writ of men more wickedness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the mark of Adam may redress.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"Than all the mark" is than all that bear the mark or image of Adam.
Pope's version, in which the wife asks the question and tamely answers
it, is flat in comparison with the scornful repetition of the emphatic
"who?" Yet he has employed this reduplication of a predominant word at
ver. 397, where it has much less effect. Judiciously used, there is
force and beauty in the turn, as in the couplet from Addison's
translation of Ovid:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her sisters often, as 'tis said, would cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fie, Salmacis, what always idle, fie:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_570" id="Footnote_35_570"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_570"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Pope, misapplying the original, has adopted an image which
is astronomically false. Chaucer spoke the language of astrology, and
said that each of these planets fell in the exaltation of the other; for
a planet was in its exaltation when it was in the sign of the zodiac,
where it was supposed to exercise its greatest influence, and fell, or
was in its dejection, in the sign where it exercised the least. Mercury,
the god of science, was in his exaltation in Virgo, where Venus, the
goddess of love, had no sway. Venus was in her exaltation in Pisces, and
there Mercury was in his dejection. A man could not be under the
government of incompatible planetary powers, and since scholars served
Mercury,

Amphiaraus to join the expedition against Thebes, although he assured

return, she and her paramour entrapped and murdered him.</p></div>

<span class="i0">All suddenly three leaves have I plight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of this booke that he had, and eke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I with my fist so took him on the cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in our fire he fell backward adown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he upstert as doth a wood leoun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his fist he smote me on the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the floor I lay as I were dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he saw so stille that I lay<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And for my land thus hastow murdered me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I be dead, yet will I kisse thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"Pine" is pain; "fine" is cease; "plight" is plucked; "wood" is mad; and
"braide" is awoke. Pope has dropped the natural circumstance of the
clerk's terror when he fancies he has killed his wife. This alarm brings
out more strongly the hypocrisy of his virulent dame in pretending that
the blow he gave her on the head, after she had torn the leaves out of
his book and knocked him backwards into the fire, was with the
deliberate design of murdering her to get possession of her property.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_576" id="Footnote_41_576"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_576"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Pope's translation is mawkish, and his "adieu, my dear,
adieu!" destroys the point of the story. The wife of Bath seconds the
blow with reproaches instead of with terms of endearment, nor does she
consent to be pacified until the clerk surrenders at discretion. Had she
relaxed before her conquest was complete, she would have lost the
opportunity of establishing her dominion. After the line, "Ere I be
dead, yet will I kisse thee," Chaucer thus continues:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And near he came, and kneeleth fairadown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saide, Deare sister Alisoun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As help me God, I shall thee never smite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I have done it is thyself to wite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive it me, and that I thee beseke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet oftsoon I hit him on the cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saide, Thief thus muchel I me wreke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now will I die, I may no longer speak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But atte last, with muchel care and woe<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And of his tongue, and of his hand also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made him burn his book anon right tho.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"To wite" is to blame; "I me wreke" is "I revenge myself;" and "tho" is
then. As soon as the poor clerk consented to have no will of his own,
and to be governed like a school-boy by his master, the dame declares,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

It must have been holiday time with him, notwithstanding, when the wife
of Bath set out on one of her pilgrimages, and left him in peace at
home.</p></div>

<h2><span class="smcap">THE TEMPLE OF FAME: a vision.</span></h2>

<h3>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Pope</span>.</h3>

<h4>8vo.</h4>

<p class="center">London: Printed for <span class="smcap">Bernard Lintott</span>, betwixt the two Temple Gates in
Fleet Street. 1715.</p>


<p>This is the first edition. A second edition, which I have not seen, is
advertised by Lintot in some of the lists of his publications. Dennis,
in the Observations he put forth on the poem in 1717, asks Pope if there
are no women who are worthy to appear in the Temple of Fame, and
immediately adds, "Divers, he says, but he thought he should affront the
modesty of the sex in showing them there." The remark does not occur in
the first edition, nor in the reprints of the poem in Pope's collected
works, and it may, perhaps, have been taken from the second edition. As
the production disappointed the expectations raised by the name of the
author the sale was probably not large. The piece was included in the
quarto of 1717, and in the editions of Lintot's Miscellanies which came
out in 1727 and 1732, but was not in the editions of 1720 and 1722.
Lintot paid 32<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> for the copyright on Feb. 1, 1715.</p>

<p>The hint of the following piece was taken from Chaucer's House of Fame.
The design is in a manner entirely altered, the descriptions and most of
the particular thoughts my own: yet I could not suffer it to be printed
without this acknowledgment,<a name="FNanchor_1_577" id="FNanchor_1_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_577" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or think a concealment of this nature
the less unfair for being common. The reader who would compare this with
Chaucer, may begin with his third Book of Fame, there being nothing in
the two first books that answers to their title.<a name="FNanchor_2_578" id="FNanchor_2_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_578" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Whenever any hint is
taken from him, the passage itself is set down in the marginal

<p>Some modern critics, from a pretended refinement of taste, have declared
themselves unable to relish allegorical poems.<a name="FNanchor_4_580" id="FNanchor_4_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_580" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is not easy to
penetrate into the meaning of this criticism; for if fable be allowed
one of the chief beauties, or, as Aristotle calls it, the very soul of
poetry, it is hard to comprehend how that fable should be the less
valuable for having a moral. The ancients constantly made use of
allegories. My Lord Bacon has composed an express treatise in proof of
this, entitled, The Wisdom of the Ancients; where the reader may see
several particular fictions exemplified and explained with great
clearness, judgment, and learning. The incidents, indeed, by which the
allegory is conveyed, must be varied according to the different genius
or manners of different times; and they should never be spun too long,
or too much clogged with trivial circumstances, or little
particularities. We find an uncommon charm in truth, when it is conveyed
by this sideway to our understanding: and it is observable, that even in
the most ignorant ages this way of writing has found reception. Almost
all the poems in the old Proven&ccedil;al had this turn; and from these it was
that Petrarch took the idea of his poetry. We have his Trionfi in this
kind; and Boccace pursued in the same track. Soon after, Chaucer
introduced it here, whose Romaunt of the Rose, Court of Love, Flower and
the Leaf, House of Fame, and some others of his writings, are
masterpieces of this sort. In epic poetry, it is true, too nice and
exact a pursuit of the allegory is justly esteemed a fault; and Chaucer
had the discernment to avoid it in his Knight's Tale, which was an
attempt towards an epic poem. Ariosto, with less judgment, gave entirely
into it in his Orlando; which, though carried to an excess, had yet so
much reputation in Italy, that Tasso (who reduced heroic poetry to the
juster standard of the ancients) was forced to prefix to his work a
scrupulous explanation of the allegory of it, to which the fable itself
could scarce have directed his readers. Our countryman, Spenser,
followed, whose poem is almost entirely allegorical, and imitates the
manner of Ariosto rather than that of Tasso. Upon the whole, one may
observe this sort of writing, however discontinued of late, was in all
times, so far from being rejected by the best poets, that some of them
have rather erred by insisting on it too closely, and carrying it too
far; and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> to infer from thence that the allegory itself is vicious,
is a presumptuous contradiction to the judgment and practice of the
greatest geniuses, both ancient and modern.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p>

<p>Pope, as he tells Steele in their correspondence (Nov. 16, 1712), had
written the Temple of Fame two years before, that is, when he was only
twenty-two years old, an early time of life for so much learning and so
much observation as that work exhibits. It has, as Steele warmly
declared, a "thousand beauties." Every part is splendid; there is great
luxuriance of ornaments; the original vision of Chaucer was never denied
to be much improved; the allegory is very skilfully continued, the
imagery is properly selected and learnedly displayed; yet with all this
comprehension of excellence, as its scene is laid in remote ages, and
its sentiments, if the concluding paragraph be excepted, have little
relation to general manners or common life, it never obtained much
notice, but is turned silently over and seldom quoted or mentioned with
either praise or blame.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>It was, to the Italians we owed anything that could be called poetry,
from whom Chaucer, imitated by Pope in this vision, copied largely, as
<i>they</i> are said to have done from the bards of Provence. But whatever
Chaucer might copy from the Italians, yet the artful and entertaining
plan of his Canterbury Tales was purely original and his own. This
admirable piece, even exclusive of its poetry, is highly valuable, as it
preserves to us the liveliest and exactest picture of the manners,
customs, characters, and habits, of our forefathers, whom he has brought
before our eyes acting as on a stage, suitably to their different orders
and employments. With these portraits the driest antiquary must be
delighted. By this plan, he has more judiciously connected these stories
which the guests relate, than Boccace has done his novels, whom he has
imitated, if not excelled, in the variety of the subjects of his tales.
It is a common mistake, that Chaucer's excellence lay in his manner of
treating light and ridiculous subjects; for whoever will attentively
consider the noble poem of Palamon and Arcite, will be convinced that he
equally excels in the pathetic and the sublime. The House of Fame, as
being merely descriptive, is of an inferior rank to those in Chaucer of
the narrative kind, and which paint life and manners. The design is
improved and heightened by the masterly hand of Pope. It is not
improbable that this subject was suggested to our author, not only by
Dryden's translations of Chaucer, of which Pope was so fond, but
likewise by that celebrated paper of Addison, in the Tatler, called the
Table of Fame, to which the great worthies of antiquity are introduced,
and seated according to their respective merits and characters, and
which was published some years before this poem was written. The six
persons Pope thought proper to select as worthy to be placed on the
highest seats of honour are Homer, Virgil, Pindar, Horace, Aristotle,
Tully. It is observable that our author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> has omitted the great dramatic
poets of Greece. Sophocles and Euripides deserved certainly an
honourable niche in the Temple of Fame, as much as Pindar and Horace.
But the truth is it was not fashionable in Pope's time, nor among his
acquaintance, attentively to study these poets. I own I have some
particular reasons for thinking that he was not very conversant in this
sort of composition, having no inclination to the drama. In a note on
the third book of his Homer, where Helen points out to Priam the names
and characters of the Grecian leaders from the walls of Troy, he
observes, that several great poets have been engaged by the beauty of
this passage to an imitation of it. But who are the poets he enumerates
on this occasion? Only Statius and Tasso; the former of whom, in his
seventh book, and the latter in his third, shows the forces and the
commanders that invested the cities of Thebes and Jerusalem. Not a
syllable is mentioned of that capital scene in the Ph&oelig;niss&aelig; of
Euripides, from the hundred and twentieth to the two hundredth line,
where the old man, standing with Antigone on the walls of Thebes, marks
out to her the various figures, habits, armour, and qualifications of
each different warrior, in the most lively and picturesque manner, as
they appear in the camp beneath them. In conclusion, we may observe that
Pope's alterations of Chaucer are introduced with judgment and art, and
that these alterations are more in number, and more important in
conduct, than any Dryden has made of the same author.</p>

<p>The Temple of Fame was communicated to Steele, who entertained a high
opinion of its beauties, and who conveyed it to Addison. Pope had
ornamented the poem with the machinery of guardian angels, which he
afterwards omitted. He speaks of his work with a diffidence uncommon in
a young poet, and which does him credit. "No errors," he says to Steele,
"are so trivial but they deserve to be mended. I could point you to
several; but it is my business to be informed of those faults I do not
know, and as for those I do, not to talk of them but to correct them.
You speak of that poem in a style I neither merit nor expect, but, I
assure you, if you freely mark or dash out, I shall look upon your blots
to be its greatest beauties,&mdash;I mean, if Mr. Addison and yourself should
like it in the whole. I am afraid of nothing so much as to impose
anything on the world which is unworthy its acceptance."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>Chaucer's poem contains great strokes of Gothic imagination, yet
bordering often on the most ideal and capricious extravagance. Pope has
imitated this piece with his usual elegance of diction and harmony of
versification; but, in the mean time, he has not only misrepresented the
story, but marred the character of the poem. He has endeavoured to
correct its extravagancies by new refinements and additions of another
cast; but he did not consider that extravagancies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> are essential to a
poem of such a structure, and even constitute its beauties. An attempt
to unite order and exactness of imagery with a subject formed on
principles so professedly romantic and anomalous, is like giving
Corinthian pillars to a Gothic palace. When I read Pope's elegant
imitation of this piece, I think I am walking among the modern monuments
unsuitably placed in Westminster Abbey.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Warton.</span></p>

<p>Little can be added to T. Warton's masterly appreciation of the
characteristic merit of this poem. May I be just allowed to mention,
that there is less harmony of versification in this poem, than in most
of the preceding, particularly the Rape of the Lock, Elegy to an
Unfortunate Lady, and, above all, the Epistle of Eloisa. The pause is
too generally at the end of the line, and on the fourth and fifth
syllable. Pope bids</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">The Muses raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden trumpet of eternal praise.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chaucer with a bolder personification sends for Eolus, "that king of
Thrace," from "his cave of stone," to sound his "trump of gold." These
circumstances may designate in some measure the character of either
poem. I must confess I think there can be no comparison between the bold
trump of Eolus which he set</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i17">To his mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blew it east, and west, and south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And north, as loud as any thunder,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the delicate but less animated tone of the Muses in Pope.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>If Chaucer was indebted to any of the Italian poets for the idea of his
House of Fame, it was to Petrarca, who in his Trionfo della Fama has
introduced many of the most eminent characters of ancient times. It must
however be observed, that the poem of Petrarca is extremely simple and
inartificial, and consists only in supposing that the most celebrated
men of ancient Greece and Rome pass in review before him; whilst that of
Chaucer is the work of a powerful imagination, abounding with beautiful
and lively descriptions, and forming a connected and consistent whole.
Pope's Temple of Fame is one of the noblest, though earliest,
productions of the author, displaying a fertile invention and an
uncommon grandeur and facility of style. It is confessedly founded on
Chaucer's House of Fame; but the design is greatly altered and improved,
and many of the thoughts and descriptions are entirely his own; yet such
is the coincidence and happy union of the work with its prototype, that
it is almost impossible to distinguish those portions for which he is
indebted to Chaucer from those of his own invention. The conclusion, as
descriptive of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> own feelings at an early period of his own life, is
particularly interesting.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Roscoe.</span></p>

<p>Chaucer's House of Fame is adorned with statues</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of all manner of minstrales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gestours that tellen tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both of weeping and of game.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Just such a gestour, or narrative poet, was Chaucer himself; for, as
Warton has remarked, he excelled alike in the pathetic and the gay, and,
if he was more admirable in one than in the other, his "tales of
weeping" were superior to his "tales of game." None of our poets, except
Shakespeare, can compete with him in versatility of genius. His numerous
characters are conceived with equal truth and distinctness; his dialogue
is lively and natural; his humour is sometimes broad, sometimes subtle,
and always racy; his tenderness is unrivalled in its mingled depth,
simplicity and refinement; his descriptions, whether serious or comic,
have never been surpassed in ease and vividness. His pre-eminence
appears the more conspicuous when we contrast his living strains with
the feeble diffuse monotony of his successors and predecessors. He may
be compared, says Thomas Warton, to a premature summer's day in an
English spring. The autobiographical passages in his works afford a
glimpse of the varied tastes and pursuits which rendered him one of the
most comprehensive writers in the world. His keen observation of mankind
was blended with the plodding of a student. He tells us that he lived
the life of a hermit, and was entirely ignorant of what was passing
among the neighbours who "dwelt almost at his door." His custom when the
duties of the day were over was to withdraw to his house, and sit down
"as dumb as any stone" to his books, till he was "dazed" with reading.
His love of nature could alone compete in intensity with his love of
literature. The single thing which had power to entice him from the
studies he held "in reverence" was the singing of birds and the blooming
of flowers. The month of May had a peculiar fascination for him. "Then,"
he exclaims, "farewell my book," and transported by the opening beauties
of the year he gave himself up to the exhilarating effects of renovated
nature. The "flower of flowers," in his eyes, was the daisy, and there
was never a morning that he was not out at dawn in the meadows, kneeling
on the "soft, sweet grass," and watching his little favourite unclose
its petals to the sun. In the evening he returned to see the daisies "go
to rest," and no sooner were they shut up than he hastened home to bed,
that he might be awake in time to witness the renewal of the scene. The
sight was to him so "blissful" that it "softened all his sorrow," nor
did the commonness of the occurrence abate the charm. He protests that
he still feels within him the fire which impelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> him to rise with glad
devotion before break of day that he might behold the resurrection of
his cherished flower, and do it reverence; for the friendly daisy was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Ever alike fair and fresh of hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I love it, and ever alike new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever shall till that mine hearte die.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These traits present a charming picture of the man, and they are
enhanced by the modesty which accompanied his greatness. He always
speaks of his writings with unaffected humility, as those of a person
who from taste was a diligent cultivator of poetry without possessing
the faculty to become a worthy poet.</p>

<p>The House of Fame cannot be ranked with Chaucer's best productions. The
incidents are supposed to pass in a dream, which was his ordinary plan
for avoiding the infringement of probability when he exchanged
terrestrial realities for the visions of fancy. He repeatedly in his
works does homage to the happy influence of love. He maintained that it
was the parent of the choicest qualities among mankind, though he
sometimes adulterates his loftier sentiments by intermingling voluptuous
passion with the pure affections of the heart,&mdash;a defect which was usual
with the medi&aelig;val "gestours." He reverts in the House of Fame to his
favourite theme, and the first book is taken up with a description of
the temple of Venus. The entire edifice was of glass that was radiant
with paintings representing subjects from Ovid and Virgil. Chaucer
flourished in the finest period of Gothic architecture, when the
"storied windows richly dight" were the delight of the age, and his
detailed enumeration of the pictured incidents were not, to his
contemporaries, the dry catalogue they may appear to us. After examining
the marvellous gallery, he walks out of the building to seek for some
one to inform him in what country he may be. He finds that the
surrounding district is a desert as far as the eye can reach, without
house, tree, herbage, or living creature, till gazing upwards he beholds
an eagle aloft in the sky.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was of gold, and shone so bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never saw men such a sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if the heaven had ywon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All new of God another sun.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The book concludes with the announcement that the gorgeous eagle began
somewhat to descend, and this is followed in the second book by the bird
catching sight of Chaucer, and stooping upon him with the rapidity of
lightning. In an instant it catches him up in its claws, and "as lightly
as if he was a lark" soars with him into the clouds. He swoons with
fright, and is restored to consciousness by the eagle calling him by
name, and rebuking him for his fears. Having calmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> him, the bird
informs him why he has been sent to fetch him, and bear him aloft into
the skies. Chaucer more than once confesses that he was not framed to
win affection. He says he did "not dare to love for his unlikeliness,"
and that he might "go in the dance" with those whom it had not been
Cupid's pleasure to prosper. Yet his quick and glowing sympathies had
led him to employ his genius in celebrating a blessing of which he had
tasted so sparingly, and he is now told that his disinterested service
to Venus and Cupid, in devoting the hours of night to composing poems on
the histories of lovers till his head aches, has attracted the notice of
Jupiter, who intends to reward him by admitting him to a view of the
palace of Fame. The eagle continues rising upwards with his burthen, and
expounds to Chaucer as they go the situation of the building, and the
means by which everything said and done on earth is known in the distant
sanctuary of the goddess. Arrived there, the winged messenger of Jupiter
sets the poet down, and bidding him farewell, expresses a hope that the
God of heaven will send him grace to learn some good from the scenes
which are about to be unveiled to him. The third book contains the
account of the House of Fame, and the House of Rumour, and despite the
previous announcement of the extraordinary disclosures which await him,
Chaucer has copied several of his leading ideas from Ovid and Virgil. In
the House of Fame he witnesses the caprice with which the goddess
dispenses reputation and disgrace; and in the House of Rumour he learns
that nothing can exceed the lying and deception which are practised by
mercenary ecclesiastics for the sake of lucre. His honest nature and
penetrating understanding repudiated the impostures of the Romish
church, and it was the main lesson which he seemed to wish to inculcate
in his poem.</p>

<p>It is stated by Pope in his prefatory advertisement that the House of
Fame had only supplied him with the "hint" for the Temple of Fame, that
"the design was entirely altered," and that "the descriptions, and most
of the particular thoughts, were his own." Bowles says that "Pope seems
unwilling to confess all he owes to Chaucer," and that his language
would "lead us to conclude that the chief merit of the arrangement and
imagination belonged to himself," whereas he is indebted to his
predecessor for "what is most poetical in the whole composition." Pope
cannot be accused of concealing his obligations to the House of Fame,
for he has fairly specified them in his notes, but he extremely
underrated the extent to which he borrowed from it when he fancied that
his general outline was different, and "most of the particular thoughts
entirely new." The fertility of invention ascribed to him by Roscoe, and
which he, in some degree, challenges for himself, is the last praise he
can claim. Every portion of the conception which has a touch of creative
power is found in Chaucer, together with the largest part of what is
good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> in the filling up. High authorities differ as to the effect of
Pope's additions and variations. Thomas Warton pronounced that "the
character of the poem was marred," and Bowles endorsed the criticism.
Johnson, on the other hand, asserts that "the original vision was never
denied to be much improved," and he had Joseph Warton, Roscoe, and
Campbell on his side. "Much of Chaucer's fantastic matter," says
Campbell, "has been judiciously omitted by Pope, who at the same time
has clothed the best ideas of the old poem in spirited numbers and
expression. Chaucer supposes himself to be snatched up to heaven by a
large eagle, who addresses him in the name of St. James and the Virgin
Mary. In Pope, the philosophy of fame comes with much more propriety
from the poet himself than from the beak of a talkative eagle."<a name="FNanchor_5_581" id="FNanchor_5_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_581" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
introduction of the majestic eagle, its tremendous swoop when it pounces
on the lonely wanderer, the terror produced by the first stage of the
flight, and the animated dialogue in the second stage, is the most
striking portion of Chaucer's vision. The philosophic discourse of the
bird is not inconsistent with the wild imaginings of a dream. "Fantastic
matter" is here the most natural, and keeps up an illusion which
disappears in the formal composition of Pope. The advantage of modern
language and versification would have rendered it easy for a man less
gifted than him to improve on isolated passages, but the free fancy and
picturesqueness of Chaucer are wanting. The romance which constitutes
the truth and charm of the original dream is replaced by a scene of
frigid tameness; and Johnson, while declaring that every part of the
remodelled piece was splendid, is compelled to admit that it is turned
silently over and takes no hold on the mind. Dullness is a fatal
innovation which is poorly compensated by the greater polish of the
style, and harmony of the verse.</p>

<p>The Temple of Fame suffered from a cause which deteriorated much of
Pope's early poetry,&mdash;the notion that the noblest exercise of mind was
to magnify the ancients, and reproduce their ideas. The epic poem he
commenced at thirteen was naturally a school-boy's "slavish imitation"
of Greek and Latin authors.<a name="FNanchor_6_582" id="FNanchor_6_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_582" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A magnificent modern literature, marked
by the strongest lines of native vigour and masculine independence,
might have been expected, as he grew acquainted with it, to expand his
taste. This effect did not ensue. Led astray by the false conventional
canons of hacknied criticism, he clung to his early prejudices, and,
regardless of the splendid names which gave the lie to his theory, he
could say, at the age of thirty, in the preface to his works, "All that
is left us is to recommend our productions by the imitation of the
ancients." He told Spence that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> he should certainly have tried his hand
upon a second epic if he had not translated the Iliad, and this epic, in
its main characteristics, would not have differed much from his
translation. "I should have sat down to it," he said, "with this
advantage, that I had been nursed up in Homer and Virgil."<a name="FNanchor_7_583" id="FNanchor_7_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_583" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He once
intended to take the Corinthian Timoleon for his hero; and scene,
manners, personages, machinery, and sentiments would all have been as
Greek as they could be made by an imitator who had not entered deeply
into the spirit of classic writers and times. The everlasting interest
attached to the Iliad,&mdash;to a poem original and national, reflecting the
institutions, customs, feelings, and beliefs of its era,&mdash;would, he
thought, be extended to a modern duplicate, in which every one of these
qualities would have been reversed. "The less we copy the ancients,"
said Dr. Young, "we shall resemble them the more." The undue exaltation
of antiquity is complete in the Temple of Fame. No English king,
warrior, statesman, or patriot; no Christian martyr or evangeliser; no
poet or philosopher was deemed worthy to be ranked with the men of old.
The fictitious phantoms of heathen mythology, the heroes of decayed
empires, and the authors whose works are in dead languages, are the sole
immortals of Pope. Within the limits of his narrow world several of his
names appear to have been selected at random, and others are applauded
upon mistaken principles. He extols the virtue of Brutus, whose chief
glory was to have plotted the death of his preserver, patron, and
friend. Nations do not need, and virtue disowns the patriotism which
manifests itself in ingratitude, treachery, and murder. Pope's
admiration of tyrannicides even led him to celebrate Timoleon for
killing his brother, notwithstanding that Timoleon had forfeited his
claim to the panegyric by bitterly repenting his crime. To consecrate
political assassinations is to put the lives of rulers at the mercy of
any individual who conceives their policy to be mischievous. In short,
the portion of the Temple of Fame which was not directly borrowed from
Chaucer is merely a school-boy's theme in verse. The manner in which
Pope sets forth his worthies is not, for him, felicitous. His portraits
are nearly all faint and feeble sketches, without distinctness of
outline, individuality of feature, or brilliancy of colouring.</p>

<p>The contemporary literature of the middle ages could not compete with
the classical masterpieces, and Chaucer might have been justified in
peopling his House of Fame with ancients alone. But he does not believe
that genius and grandeur expired with the Romans. He has faith in
authors whose light has long since been dimmed or extinguished, and
confidently ranks such writers as Guido de Columpnis and Geoffrey of
Monmouth with the loftiest Greek and Latin names.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> The statues of
minstrel bards, musicians, and professors of magic adorn the exterior of
the palace; the wall within is crowded with heralds, and on their coats
are embroidered the armorial ensigns of all the persons who had been
famous in Europe, Asia, and Africa since chivalry began. Everywhere we
have the true reflection of the world in which Chaucer lived. His
narrative represents the fourteenth century, its actual pursuits and
genuine tastes, while the modernised version of Pope is stripped of
circumstantial realities, and exhibits only an impassive, artificial
pedantry.</p>

<p>The architecture of Pope's Temple and Chaucer's House presents the same
difference which distinguishes the respective poems throughout. The
House is in the magnificent Gothic of the time, with its multiplied
buttresses, niches, images, pinnacles, and traceried windows. The Temple
is a building which resembles nothing that ever existed. One face is
Grecian architecture, a second Eastern, a third Egyptian, and a fourth
Northern. Warton, in a note to the poem, says that Pope's "knowledge and
taste in the fine arts were unquestionable." Had he possessed the
crudest ideas of architecture he could not have affirmed that so
hideous, and indeed so impossible a combination, surpassed in beauty
whatever had been "beheld in proud Rome, or artful Greece, or elder
Babylon." The details are worthy of the general conception. The northern
side is said to be "of Gothic structure,"&mdash;not the glorious style which
commonly bears the name, a style for which Pope had no eyes, since with
Chaucer's description before him he ignores the medi&aelig;val Gothic
altogether, but a structure lustrous as glass, and "overwrought with
ornaments of barbarous pride." "Huge colosses rise" upon its face, and
around the statues are "engraved Runic characters." This part of the
design appears to be an importation from the south. In the Egyptian
temples colossal figures are often attached to the piers, and at the
top, bottom, and sides of the piers there is a border of hieroglyphics.
With his statues Pope has conjoined "rude iron columns smeared with
blood" upon which stand the "horrid forms of Scythian heroes," and in a
note he gravely asserts that this medley "is agreeable to the
architecture of the northern part of the world." In the text he has
ventured upon the no less extraordinary statement that all the fa&ccedil;ades
were of "equal grace" or in other words that his barbarous and
chimerical northern side was of equal grace with the architecture of
Greece.</p>

<p>Johnson remarks that the learning and observation exhibited in the
Temple of Fame were uncommon for a youth of twenty-two. The authority
for Pope's age was an expression in his letter to Steele, Nov. 16, 1712,
where he says of his work, "I was so diffident of it as to let it lie by
me these two years just as you now see it;" and he adds in a note,
"hence it appears this poem was writ before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> the author was twenty-two
years old." With the discrepancy usual with him when the dates of his
compositions were in question, he stated on the title-page of the
various reprints of the Temple of Fame, that it was "written in the year
1711," the first day of which found him nearer twenty-three than
twenty-two. He did not publish it till 1715, and between his
twenty-fifth year when he showed it to Steele, and his twenty-seventh
year when it appeared, he subjected the poem to an extensive revision.
"I have read over your Temple of Fame twice," wrote Steele, Nov. 12,
1712, "and cannot find anything amiss of weight enough to call a fault,
but see in it a thousand, thousand beauties." "Since you say," Pope
replied, "you see nothing that may be called a fault, can you not think
it so that I have confined the attendance of guardian spirits to
heaven's favourites only?" He remedied the defect by getting rid of the
guardian spirits; and with his own testimony to the changes which the
plan underwent, the learning can only be considered as displaying the
compass of his knowledge when he was upwards of twenty-six. It is
surprising that Johnson should have thought that a very small amount of
classical mythology, and an acquaintance with the broad characteristics
of a few celebrities of antiquity, was an unusual acquisition even for a
man of twenty-two. Warton has pointed out that the narrow range of
Pope's reading was more remarkable than its extent. He has not alluded
to the Greek tragedians, and had probably never looked into a single
play of &AElig;schylus, Sophocles, or Euripides. The observation of life,
which Johnson thought as precocious as the learning, is not of the
recondite kind, and belongs exclusively to Chaucer. In whatever light we
view the Temple of Fame it must be ranked at best with the secondary
class of Pope's productions, and the indifference with which it was
regarded up to Johnson's time has continued unabated up to ours. The
eight lines on the rocks of Zembla are fine, and there is an occasional
good line in other portions of the piece, but the poem seldom rises
above a cold, and somewhat languid elegance, and like the "pale suns"
which the author describes, it "rolls away unfelt."</p>

<span class="i0">While purer slumbers spread their golden wings)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A train of phantoms in wild order rose,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I stood, methought, betwixt earth, seas, and skies;<a name="FNanchor_9_592" id="FNanchor_9_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_592" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole creation open to my eyes:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where mountains rise, and circling oceans flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here naked rocks, and empty wastes were seen,<span class='linenum'>15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There tow'ry cities, and the forests green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here sailing ships delight the wand'ring eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There trees, and intermingled temples rise:<a name="FNanchor_11_594" id="FNanchor_11_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_594" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now a clear sun the shining scene displays;<a name="FNanchor_12_595" id="FNanchor_12_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_595" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The transient landscape now in clouds decays.<span class='linenum'>20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">O'er the wide prospect as I gazed around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like broken thunders that at distance roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or billows murm'ring on the hollow shore:<a name="FNanchor_13_596" id="FNanchor_13_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_596" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, gazing up, a glorious pile beheld,<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose tow'ring summit ambient clouds concealed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on a rock of ice the structure lay,<a name="FNanchor_14_597" id="FNanchor_14_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_597" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wondrous rock like Parian marble shone,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Critics I saw, that other names deface,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fix their own, with labour, in their place:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their own, like others, soon their place resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or disappeared, and left the first behind.<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like crystal faithful to the graving steel:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rock's high summit, in the temple's shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor heat could melt, nor beating storm invade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their names inscribed unnumbered ages past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From time's first birth, with time itself shall last;<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These ever new, nor subject to decays,<br /></span>

book ii.:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tho beheld I fields and plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now hills, and now mountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now valeys, and now forestes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now unnethes great bestes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now townes, and now great trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now shippes sayling in the sea.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Dennis objected to Pope's version that "if the whole creation was open
to his eyes" he must be too high "to discern such minute objects as
ships and trees." But the imagination in dreams conjures up appearances
which are beyond the compass of the waking powers, and it is therefore
strictly natural to represent events as passing in visions, which would
be unnatural in actual life. Added to this, Pope had before him Ovid's
description of the house of Fame, which is endued with the property of
enabling the beholder to distinguish the smallest objects however
remote:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unde quod est usquam, quamvis regionibus absit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspicitur.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Or as Sandys translates it,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where all that's done, though far removed, appears.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_596" id="Footnote_13_596"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_596"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Dryden's translation of Ovid's Met. book xii.:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Confused and chiding, like the hollow roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tides, receding from th' insulted shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or like the broken thunder heard from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jove at distance drives the rolling war.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
This is more poetically expressed than the same image in our author.
Dryden's lines are superior to the original.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
Pope copied Dryden's translation of Ovid, and for this reason did not
quote the parallel passage from Chaucer's second book of the House of
Fame, where the eagle, when they come within hearing of the swell of
indistinct voices, holds a colloquy with the poet on the phenomenon:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And what sound is it like?" quoth he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Peter! beating of the sea,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth I, "against the rockes hollow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When tempest doth the shippes swallow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or elles like the last humbling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the clap of a thundring."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"Peter" is an exclamation; and the sense is, "By St. Peter it is like
the beating of the sea against the hollow rocks." In Pope's poem no
cause is assigned for the "wild promiscuous sound." In Chaucer it is
produced by the confluence of the talk upon earth, every word of which
is conveyed to the House of Fame.</p></div>

Having complained that it was contrary to the laws of sight to suppose
that a prospect in sleep could be extended beyond the ordinary range of
mortal vision, Dennis proceeds to contend that for a rock to be
sustained in the air was contrary to the eternal laws of gravitation,
"which," says Pope sarcastically, in a manuscript note, "no dream ought
to be." The cavil of Dennis was as false in science as in criticism, for
it is not more contrary to the laws of gravitation for a rock to be
suspended in space than for the earth itself.</p></div>

Not only is the comparison defective, but the fundamental idea is
unfounded, for though excess of admiration may produce a temporary
reaction, the opinion of the world oscillates back to the middle line,
and no instance can be quoted of an author who has finally lost his due
reputation because he had once been overpraised. Chaucer makes a
different use of the image. In his poem the north side of the icy
mountain bears the names of the ancients which were safe from injury.
The sunny side bears the names of the moderns, and he perhaps intended
to intimate his opinion that the reason why their fame was less durable
than that of the Greeks and Romans was that they were a more luxurious
race, and did not in the same degree "scorn delights, and live laborious
days" for the sake of producing immortal works.</p></div>

knottiness and spaciousness of the chest, the firmness and protuberance
of the muscles in each limb, particularly the legs, and the majestic
vastness of the whole figure, undoubtedly designed by the artist to give
a full idea of strength, as the Venus de Medicis of beauty. To mention
the Hesperian apples, which the artist flung backwards, and almost
concealed as an inconsiderable object, and which therefore scarcely
appear in the statue, was below the notice of Pope.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>

employed their studies upon magic and astrology, which was, in a manner,
almost all the learning of the ancient Asian people. We have scarce any
account of a moral philosopher, except Confucius, the great law-giver of
the Chinese, who lived about two thousand years ago.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p><p>
There are several mistakes in Pope's note. Zoroaster was not a magician
who "waved the circling wand" of the necromancer. "The Magians," says
Plato, "teach the magic of Zoroaster, but this is the worship of the
Gods." His creed was theological, and had no connexion with sorcery.
Some of his nominal followers subsequently professed to be
fortune-tellers. Astrology was not a general characteristic of the
diverse nations who constituted the "ancient Asian people," and their
learning was by no means limited to it. The Hindoos, for instance, were
the precursors of Aristotle in logic, and the earliest metaphysicians
whose doctrines have come down to us. "The Indian philosophy," says M.
Cousin, "is so vast that all the philosophical systems are represented
there, and we may literally affirm that it is an abridgment of the
entire history of philosophy." Nor was Confucius the only oriental
"law-giver who taught the useful science to be good." The Hindoo body of
laws, which bears the name of Menu, was compiled centuries before
Confucius was born, and it is eminently a moral and religious, as well
as a political code.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_625" id="Footnote_42_625"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_625"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> It was often erroneously stated that the Brahmins dwelt
always in groves. By the laws of Menu the life of a Brahmin was divided
into four portions, and it was during the third portion only that he was
commanded to become an anchorite in the woods, to sleep on the bare
ground, to feed on roots and fruit, to go clad in bark or the skin of
the black antelope, and to expose himself to the drenching rain and
scorching sun. The caste have ceased to conform to the primitive
discipline, and the old asceticism is now confined to individual
devotees. The functions which Pope ascribes to the Brahmins formed no
part of their practices. They did not pretend to "stop the moon," and
summon spirits to "midnight banquets." Pope copied Oldham's version of
Virgil's eighth Eclogue:

Pope followed the narrative of Diodorus. Plutarch says that Timoleon did

countenance to the assassins. Some of the Corinthians applauded, and
some execrated his conduct. He was soon overtaken with remorse, and
shunning the haunts of men he passed years in anguish of mind.</p></div>

Pope did not perceive that in the attempt to improve the poetry he had
introduced an inconsistency. He winds up the preceding group of patriots
with the "wise Aurelius," whom he celebrates as an example of "unbounded
virtue," and the "much-suffering heroes" could not be instances of "less
guilty fame" than a man whose virtue was unbounded. The classification
was probably suggested by Addison's Vision in the Tatler of the Three
Roads of Life, and having his original in his mind when he composed his
poem, Pope avoided the inconsistency which he subsequently imported into
the passage. "The persons," says Addison, "who travelled up this great
path, were such whose thoughts were bent upon doing eminent services to
mankind, or promoting the good of their country. On each side of this
great road were several paths. These were most of them covered walks,
and received into them men of retired virtue, who proposed to themselves
the same end of their journey, though they chose to make it in shade and
obscurity."</p></div>

private life, and he probably added the illustrations later without

Since Homer is placed by Chaucer upon a pillar of iron, he places Virgil
upon iron tinned over, to indicate that the &AElig;neis was based upon the
Iliad and was both more polished and less vigorous. The sulphur upon
which Claudian stands, is typical of the hell he described in his poem
on the Rape of Proserpine. Ovid, the poet of love, is put upon a pillar
of copper, because copper was the metal of Venus; and Lucan, like Homer,
has a pillar of iron allotted to him because he celebrated in his
Pharsalia the wars of C&aelig;sar and Pompey, and, as Chaucer says,

Chaucer and Pope describe Fame as bestowing reputation upon some, and
traducing others, when their deserts were equal, but neither Pope nor
Chaucer touch upon the truth that the same person is commonly both
lauded and denounced. This is finely expressed by Milton, Samson
Agonistes, ver. 971:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fame if not double-faced is double-mouthed,<br /></span>

Besides the passage in Chaucer, Pope evidently recalled Creech's
translation of Juvenal, Sat. xiii. 132.

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

trumpets, a golden trumpet, from which he gives forth praises, and a
black trumpet of brass, from which he sends forth blasts of slander. In
Pope the golden trumpet is blown by the muses, and the trump of slander
sounds without the mention of any agent.</p></div>

various suppliants, Pope is detailing the manner in which praise and
blame are dispensed in this world, and it is a departure from reality to
consign the entire race of conquerors to oblivion. However little they
may deserve fame, they at least obtain it. The inconsistency is the more
glaring that when he describes the temple in the opening of the poem, he
tells us that,

Pope makes everybody obtain fame who seeks to avoid it, which is absurd.
Chaucer keeps to truth. The first company came,

<p>
"I grant you all your asking," she replies; "let your works be dead."
The second company arrive immediately afterwards, and prefer the same
request in the lines versified by Pope, when Fame, with her usual
capriciousness, refuses their prayer, and orders Eolus to sound their
praises.</p></div>

these coxcombs is sure to have his name rotten before his carcase. When
the author introduced these fellows into the temple of Fame, he ought to
have made the chocolate-house, and the side-box, part of it." The
criticism was just. The contemptible creatures who buzzed their
profligate falsehoods for the hour, and were heard of no more, should
have been introduced, if at all, into the Temple of Rumour, and not into
the Temple of Fame. Pope followed Chaucer.</p></div>

ice, and Dennis charges him with departing from his allegory when he
describes the self-indulgent multitude, who are "even fatigued with
ease," as having toiled up the "steep and slippery ascent" to present
themselves before the goddess. There is the same defect in Chaucer.</p></div>

Pope in this paragraph had not only Chaucer in view, but the passage of

In Ovid the scene is laid in the house of Fame. Pope lays it in the
house of Rumour, and having left Fame enthroned in her own temple, he
now represents her as permanently "sitting aloft" in a totally different

third book, but here more naturally made the conclusion, with the
addition of a moral to the whole. In Chaucer, he only answers, "he came
to see the place;" and the book ends abruptly, with his being surprized
at the sight of a man of great authority, and awaking in a
fright.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p><p>
This is an imperfect representation. While Chaucer is standing in the
House of Fame, a person goes up to him,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And saide, Friend, what is thy name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Artow come hither to have fame?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The poet disclaims any such intention, and protests that he has no
desire that his name should be known to a single soul. He is then asked
what he does there, and he replies that he who brought him to the place
promised him that he should learn new and wonderful things, in which, he
says, he has been disappointed, for he was aware before that people
coveted fame, though he was not hitherto acquainted with the dwelling of
the goddess, nor with her appearance and condition. His interrogator
answers that he perceives what it is he desires to know, and conducts
him to the house of Rumour. There he has revealed to him the falsehood
of the world, and especially of pilgrims and pardoners, which was an
important doctrine to be inculcated in those days. When the scene has
been fully disclosed, "a man of great authority" appears, and the poet
starts up from his sleep, by which he seems to intimate that the wise
and serious frown upon those who listen to idle tales. His awaking "half
afraid," is the result of his
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Remembring well what I had seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how high and far I had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my ghost.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Pope, by reserving the inquiry addressed to him for the end of the poem,
represents himself as being asked in the temple of Rumour whether he has
come there for fame, which, is not more, but much less natural than the
arrangement of Chaucer, who supposes the question to be put in the
temple of Fame itself. Nor would it have been congenial to Chaucer's
modest disposition to make himself the climax of the piece.</p></div>

<p>
Pope's moral is inconsistent with the previous tone of his poem. He has
not treated the "second life in others' breath" as "vain," but speaks of
the position of Homer, Aristotle, &amp;c. in the temple of Fame as though it
were a substantial triumph, a real dignity, and a glorious reward. The
purport of his piece is to enforce, and not to depreciate, the value of
literary renown. His whole life attests that this was his genuine
opinion. He was not endowed with the equanimity which neither covets nor
despises reputation, and it was pure affectation when he pretended, in
the concluding paragraph, that he did not "call for the favours of
fame," and that he held posthumous fame, in particular, to be a
worthless possession.</p></div>

<h2>DISCOURSE ON PASTORAL.</h2>

<p>These Pastorals were written at the age of sixteen, and then passed
through the hands of Mr. Walsh, Mr. Wycherley, G. Granville, afterwards
Lord Lansdowne, Sir William Trumbull, Dr. Garth, Lord Halifax, Lord
Somers, Mr. Mainwaring, and others. All these gave our author the
greatest encouragement, and particularly Mr. Walsh, whom Mr. Dryden, in
his postscript to Virgil, calls the best critic of his age. "The
author," says he, "seems to have a particular genius for this kind of
poetry, and a judgment that much exceeds his years. He has taken very
freely from the ancients. But what he has mixed of his own with theirs
is no way inferior to what he has taken from them. It is not flattery at
all to say that Virgil had written nothing so good at his age. His
preface is very judicious and learned." Letter to Mr. Wycherley, Ap.
1705. The Lord Lansdowne, about the same time, mentioning the youth of
our poet, says, in a printed letter of the character of Mr. Wycherley,
that "if he goes on as he hath begun in the pastoral way, as Virgil
first tried his strength, we may hope to see English poetry vie with the
Roman." Notwithstanding the early time of their production, the author
esteemed these as the most correct in the versification, and musical in
the numbers, of all his works. The reason for his labouring them into so
much softness, was, doubtless, that this sort of poetry derives almost
its whole beauty from a natural ease of thought and smoothness of verse:
whereas that of most other kinds consist in the strength and fulness of
both. In a letter of his to Mr. Walsh about this time, we find an
enumeration of several niceties in versification, which perhaps have
never been strictly observed in any English poem, except in these
Pastorals. They were not printed till 1709.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p>

<p>The sycophancy of A. Philips, who had prejudiced Mr. Addison against
Pope, occasioned those papers<a name="FNanchor_1_716" id="FNanchor_1_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_716" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in the Guardian, written by the latter,
in which there is an ironical preference given to the Pastorals of
Philips above his own, in order to support the profound judgment of
those who could not distinguish between the rural and the rustic, and on
that account condemned the Pastorals of Pope for wanting simplicity.
These papers were sent by an unknown hand to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> Steele, and the irony
escaping him, he communicated them to Mr. Pope, declaring he would never
publish any paper where one of the club was complimented at the expense
of another. Pope told him he was too delicate, and insisted that the
papers should be published in the Guardian. They were so. And the
pleasantry escaped all but Addison, who, taking Pope aside,<a name="FNanchor_2_717" id="FNanchor_2_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_717" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> said to
him in his agreeable manner, "You have put your friends here in a very
ridiculous light, as will be seen when it is understood, as it soon must
be, that you were only laughing at the admirers of Philips." But this
ill conduct of Philips occasioned a more open ridicule of his Pastorals
in the mock poem called the Shepherd's Week, written by Gay. But though
more open, the object of it was ill understood<a name="FNanchor_3_718" id="FNanchor_3_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_718" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by those who were
strangers to the quarrel. These mistook the Shepherd's Week for a
burlesque of Virgil's Pastorals. How far this goes towards a vindication
of Philips's simple painting, let others judge.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton.</span></p>

<p>In 1704 Pope wrote his Pastorals, which were shown to the poets and
critics of that time. As they well deserved, they were read with
admiration, and many praises were bestowed upon them and upon the
preface, which is both elegant and learned in a high degree. They were,
however, not published till five years afterwards. Cowley, Milton, and
Pope are distinguished among the English poets by the early exertion of
their powers; but the works of Cowley alone were published in his
childhood, and, therefore, of him only can it be certain that his
juvenile performances received no improvement from his maturer studies.
The Pastorals were at last printed [1709] in Tonson's Miscellany, in a
volume which began with the Pastorals of Philips, and ended with those
of Pope. It seems natural for a young poet to initiate himself by
pastorals, which, not professing to imitate real life, require no
experience, and exhibiting only the simple operation of unmingled
passions, admit no subtle reasoning or deep inquiry. Pope's Pastorals
are not, however, composed but with close thought; they have reference
to the time of the day, the seasons of the year, and the periods of
human life. The last, that which turns the attention upon age and death,
was the author's favourite. To tell of disappointment and misery, to
thicken the darkness of futurity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> and perplex the labyrinth of
uncertainty, has been always a delicious employment of the poets. His
preference was probably just. I wish, however, that his fondness had not
overlooked the line in which the <i>Zephyrs</i> are made <i>to lament in
silence</i>. To charge these pastorals with want of invention is to require
what was never intended. The imitations are so ambitiously frequent that
the writer evidently means rather to show his literature than his wit.
It is surely sufficient for an author of sixteen, not only to be able to
copy the poems of antiquity with judicious selection, but to have
obtained sufficient power of language and skill in metre to exhibit a
series of versification which had in English poetry no precedent, nor
has since had an imitation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>It is somewhat strange that in the pastorals of a young poet there
should not be found a single rural image that is new; but this, I am
afraid, is the case in the Pastorals before us. The ideas of Theocritus,
Virgil, and Spenser are, indeed, here exhibited in language equally
mellifluous and pure; but the descriptions and sentiments are trite and
common. To this assertion, formerly made, Dr. Johnson answered, "that no
invention was intended." He, therefore, allows the fact and the charge.
It is a confession of the very fault imputed to them. There <i>ought</i> to
have been invention. It has been my fortune from my way of life,<a name="FNanchor_4_719" id="FNanchor_4_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_719" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to
have seen many compositions of youths of sixteen years old, far beyond
these Pastorals in point of genius and imagination, though not perhaps
of correctness. Their excellence, indeed, might be owing to having had
such a predecessor as Pope.<a name="FNanchor_5_720" id="FNanchor_5_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_720" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A mixture of British and Grecian ideas
may justly be deemed a blemish in these Pastorals, and propriety is
certainly violated when he couples Pactolus with Thames, and Windsor
with Hybla.<a name="FNanchor_6_721" id="FNanchor_6_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_721" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Complaints of immoderate heat, and wishes to be conveyed
to cooling caverns, when uttered by the inhabitants of Greece, have a
decorum and consistency, which they totally lose in the character of a
British Shepherd,<a name="FNanchor_7_722" id="FNanchor_7_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_722" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and, Theocrites, during the ardors of Sirius, must
have heard the murmurings of a brook, and the whispers of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> pine, with
more home-felt pleasure than Pope could possibly experience upon the
same occasion. Pope himself informs us, in a note, that he judiciously
omitted the following verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And list'ning wolves grow milder as they hear<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>on account of the absurdity, which Spenser overlooked, of introducing
wolves into England. But on this principle, which is certainly a just
one, may it not be asked, why he should speak, the scene lying in
Windsor Forest, of the "sultry Sirius," of the "grateful clusters of
grapes," of "a pipe of reeds," the antique fistula, of "thanking Ceres
for a plentiful harvest," of "the sacrifice of lambs," with many other
instances that might be adduced to this purpose? That Pope, however, was
sensible of the importance of adapting images to the scene of action, is
obvious from the following example of his judgment; for in translating</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Audiit Eurotas, jussitque ediscere lauros,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he has dexterously dropped the laurels appropriated to Eurotas, as he is
speaking of the river Thames, and has rendered it</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thames heard the numbers as he flowed along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade his willows learn the moving song.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the passages which Pope has imitated from Theocritus, and his Latin
translator, Virgil, he has merited but little applause. Upon the whole,
the principal merit of these Pastorals consists in their correct and
musical versification, musical to a degree of which rhyme could hardly
be thought capable, and in giving the truest specimen of that harmony in
English verse, which is now become indispensably necessary, and which
has so forcibly and universally influenced the public ear as to have
obliged every moderate rhymer to be at least melodious. Pope lengthened
the abruptness of Waller, and at the same time contracted the exuberance
of Dryden.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Johnson does not appear sufficiently attentive to the true character
and nature of pastoral poetry. No doubt it is natural for a young poet
to initiate himself by pastorals; for what youthful heart does not glow
at the descriptions of rural nature, and scenes that accord with its own
innocency and cheerfulness; but although pastorals do not, in the sense
of Dr. Johnson, imitate real life, nor require any great insight into
human passions and characters, yet there are many things necessary in
this species of composition, more than Dr. Johnson seems to require. The
chief thing is an eye for picturesque and rural scenery, and an intimate
acquaintance with those minute and particular appearances of nature,
which alone can give a lively and original colour to the painting of
pastoral poetry. To copy the common descriptions of spring or summer,
morning or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> evening, or to iterate from Virgil the same complaints of
the same shepherds, is not surely to write pastoral poetry. It is also
difficult to conceive where is "the close thought" with which Johnson
says Pope's Pastorals are composed. They are pleasing as copies of "the
poems of antiquity," although they exhibit no striking taste in the
"selection," and they certainly exhibit a series of musical
versification, which, till their appearance, had no precedent in English
poetry. If in particular passages, I have ventured to remark that Pope
has introduced false thoughts and conceits, let us remember that we
ought not so much to wonder that he admitted any, as that they were not
more. Dryden's earlier poems are infinitely more vitiated in this
respect.</p>

<p>Warton's observations are very just, but he does not seem sufficiently
to discriminate between the softness of individual lines, which is the
chief merit of these Pastorals, and the general harmony of poetic
numbers. Let it, however, be always remembered, that Pope gave the first
idea of mellifluence, and produced a softer and sweeter cadence than
before belonged to the English couplet. Dr. Johnson thinks it will be in
vain, after Pope, to endeavour to improve the English versification, and
that it is now carried to the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of excellence.<a name="FNanchor_8_723" id="FNanchor_8_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_723" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This is
an opinion the validity of which I must be permitted to doubt. Pope
certainly gave a more correct and finished tone to the English
versification, but he sometimes wanted a variety of pause, and his nice
precision of every line prevented, in a few instances, a more musical
flow of modulated passages. But we are to consider what he did, not what
might be done, and surely there cannot be two opinions respecting his
improvement of the couplet though it does not follow that his general
rhythm has no imperfection. Johnson seems to have depreciated, or to
have been ignorant of, the metrical powers of some writers prior to
Pope. His ear seems to have been caught chiefly by Dryden, and as Pope's
versification was more equably (couplet with couplet being considered,
not passage with passage) connected than Dryden's, he thought therefore
that nothing could be added to Pope's versification. I should think it
the extreme of arrogance and folly to make my own ear the criterion of
music; but I cannot help thinking that Dryden, and of later days,
Cowper, are much more harmonious in their general versification than
Pope. I ought also to mention a neglected poem, not neglected on account
of its versification, but on account of its title and subject&mdash;Prior's
Solomon. Whoever candidly compares these writers together, unless his
ear be habituated to a certain recurrence of pauses precisely at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> the
end of a line, will not (though he will give the highest praise for
compactness, skill, precision, and force, to the undivided couplets of
Pope, separately considered)&mdash;will not, I think, assent to the position,
that in versification "what he found brickwork he left marble." I am not
afraid to own, that with the exception of the Epistle to Abelard, as
musical as it is pathetic, the verses of Pope want variety, and on this
account in some instances they want both force and harmony. In variety,
and variety only, let it be remembered, I think Pope deficient. It has
been doubted whether couplet verses ought ever to be broken. I will
appeal to Pope himself. Whenever he has done so, is there a judge of
poetical cadence who will not say it is harmonious? The instances are
few; but where they occur, are they not beautiful? If they had been too
often repeated the effect would be destroyed. But in long compositions
might not a greater variety of pauses have effect? Does not the ear feel
a lassitude at times? An idea has been started by some critics that "you
might as well have unequal columns to your house, as unequal couplets in
verse." This comparison, however, if it proves anything, proves too
much; for no one will say that every two verses in a long poem should in
quantity be exactly the same, the syllables the same, the pause the
same. This will not hold a moment in versification. If it did, then
Johnson's assertion falls to the ground; for then Dr. Darwin is a far
better versifier than Pope, and a very little pains would make a much
more consummate versificator than Dr. Darwin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>Of all Pope's various and very freely-censured writings, there are none
that appear to have met with a harsher or more fastidious reception at
the hands of his commentators and critics than his Pastorals. Without
regarding them with a sufficient reference, either to the time of life
of the author, or the objects he had in view in their composition, they
have considered them as deficient in originality and strength of
thought, because they do not more greatly abound in new and striking
images. But to say nothing of the unreasonableness of requiring "new and
striking images," on a subject which has been obvious from the earliest
ages to all mankind, and has been the general theme of poetry in every
country, period, and language, it must be observed, that it was not the
intention of Pope to rely upon the strength of his own powers, or to
attempt an original style of pastoral composition. On the contrary, he
informs us at the close of his discourse, that if those pastorals have
any merit, it is to be attributed to some good old authors, "whose
works," says he, "as I have had leisure to study, so I hope I have not
wanted care to imitate." In conceding then to Pope, that he has
exhibited "the ideas of Theocritus, Virgil, and Spenser, in language
equally mellifluous and pure," Dr. Warton has granted every thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> which
Pope endeavoured to accomplish; and the observation of Johnson, "that no
invention was intended," is, as far as the remark of Warton affects the
genius and character of Pope, a decisive answer. Nor although the scene
be laid in Windsor Forest, does there appear to be any impropriety in
referring to a pipe of reeds, the clusters of grapes, the bounty of
Ceres, and other objects connected with pastoral life, and for which the
poet has himself assigned a sufficient reason in the following
discourse. "If," he observes, "we would copy nature, it would be useful
to carry this idea along with us, that pastoral is an image of what they
call the golden age; so that we are not to describe our shepherds as
shepherds at this day really are, but as they may be conceived then to
have been when the best of men followed the employment;" to which he
adds, that "an air of piety to the gods should shine through the poem,
which so visibly appears in all the works of antiquity, and it ought to
preserve some relish of the old way of writing."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Roscoe.</span></p>

<p>The manuscript of Pope's Pastorals is still preserved among the
Richardson papers. It was lent by Mr. T. B. Hollis to Wakefield, who has
noted the variations from the published text with minute fidelity.
Richardson has done the same in his copy of the quarto of 1717, and
gives this correct description of the handwriting of the original:&mdash;"The
manuscript title of the Discourse on Pastoral Poetry, viz., An Essay on
Pastoral, and the title of the Pastorals, are written by Mr. Pope in
printing capitals so perfectly beautiful, and so exactly imitated, that
one can hardly believe they are not really from the press; the same of
all the words which would have been printed in italics throughout the
whole, which are in common printing character, the general being in
italics, beautifully formed, so as in all to imitate a printed book, but
in a fine taste of type, and form of the page and margin." Pope has
written upon the manuscript, "Mem. This copy is that which passed
through the hands of Mr. Walsh, Mr. Congreve, Mr. Mainwaring, Dr. Garth,
Mr. Granville, Mr. Southern, Sir H. Sheers, Sir William Trumbull, Lord
Halifax, Lord Wharton, Marquis of Dorchester, Duke of Bucks, &amp;c. Only
the third Eclogue was written since some of these saw the other three,
which were written as they here stand with the Essay, anno 1704. &AElig;tatis
me&aelig; 16. The alterations from this copy were upon the objections of some
of these, or my own." In his published list of the persons who had read
the Pastorals in manuscript, Pope has added the names of Wycherley and
Lord Somers, and omitted the names of Congreve, Southern, Sir H. Sheers,
Lord Wharton, the Marquis of Dorchester, and the Duke of Buckingham. His
chief adviser seems to have been Walsh, who, of all his admiring
friends, gave him, he says, the greatest encouragement. "I cannot," Pope
wrote to him July 2, 1706, "omit the first opportunity of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> you my
acknowledgments for reviewing these papers of mine. You have no less
right to correct me than the same hand that raised a tree has to prune
it." The Richardson collection contains a manuscript in which the poet
has transcribed from his Pastorals the various lines he thought
defective, and after stating his own objection to them, and subjoining
amended readings, he referred the task of selection to Walsh, who has
jotted down his decisions at the bottom of Pope's remarks. Both will be
found in the notes on the passages to which the comments of the author
and his critic relate.</p>

<p>There is no evidence, except the poet's own assertion, to prove that the
Pastorals were composed at the age of sixteen. They had been seen by
Walsh before April 20, 1705, if any dependence could be placed upon the
letter of that date which he wrote to Wycherly, when returning the
manuscript, but the letter rests on the authority of Pope alone, and
there is reason to question the correctness of the date. The letter of
Walsh to Wycherley concludes with the expression of a desire to be made
acquainted with Pope. "If," adds Walsh, "he will give himself the
trouble any morning to call at my house I shall be very glad to read the
verses over with him." The next letter is from Walsh to Pope, and the
opening sentence shows that his correspondence with the poet had only
just commenced. It appears from what follows that they had met in
London, that Walsh had carried Pope's verses into the country, and that
these verses were three of the Pastorals. Walsh expresses a hope that
when he returns to town, Pope will have some fresh verses to show him,
"for I make no doubt," he says, "but any one who writes so well, must
write more." These particulars evidently refer to the period when Walsh
first became acquainted with the Pastorals, and undertook to criticise
them. But the correspondence on the subject begins on June 24, 1706,
whence we should infer that it was in April, 1706, and not in 1705, that
Wycherley introduced Pope and his Pastorals to Walsh. The poet would
have departed from his usual practice if he had not falsified dates to
exaggerate his precocity. That he was past seventeen when he first
exhibited his Pastorals to his friends is confirmed by a passage from
the letter, in which George Granville sketches the character of
Wycherley, and invites an unnamed correspondent to meet him. "He shall
bring with him, if you will," says Granville, "a young poet, newly
inspired in the neighbourhood of Cooper's Hill, whom he and Walsh have
taken under their wing. His name is Pope. He is not above seventeen or
eighteen years of age, and promises miracles. If he goes on as he has
begun in the Pastoral way, as Virgil first tried his strength, we may
hope to see English poetry vie with the Roman, and this swan of Windsor
sing as sweetly as the Mantuan."<a name="FNanchor_9_724" id="FNanchor_9_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_724" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> Whatever may be the true date of
the Pastorals, a portion of them certainly existed before April 20,
1706, on which day Tonson, the bookseller, wrote to Pope, "I have lately
seen a pastoral of yours in Mr. Walsh's and Congreve's hands, which is
extremely fine, and is generally approved of by the best judges in
poetry. I remember I have formerly seen you at my shop, and am sorry I
did not improve my acquaintance with you. If you design your poem for
the press, no person shall be more careful in printing of it, nor no one
can give a greater encouragement to it." Three years elapsed before the
Pastorals saw the light, when Tonson became the publisher, and they
appeared on May 2, 1709, in his Sixth Miscellany. The preface, which
Walsh had read in manuscript, and which he calls "very learned and
judicious," did not come out till 1717, and then bore the title of A
Discourse on Pastoral Poetry. Johnson, repeating the language of Walsh,
says that it is "learned in a high degree;" whereas it was avowedly
compiled from two or three recent essayists, and demanded nothing from
the poet to which the term learning could be properly applied. He owed
to his second-hand authorities the arbitrary and pedantic rules which
were framed from the practice of the ancients, and which were employed
by the mechanical critics of his day to repress the free forms of modern
genius. The style would have been remarkable for its maturity, if, as
Pope professed, it had been the produce of sixteen, but the Discourse
was not printed till he was twenty-nine, and he certainly did not send
it uncorrected into the world.</p>

<p>"It must appear strange," says De Quincey, "that Pope at twenty-one
should choose to come forward for the first time with a work composed at
sixteen. A difference of five years at that stage of life is of more
effect than of twenty at a later; and his own expanding judgment could
hardly fail to inform him that his Pastorals were by far the worst of
his works. In reality, let us not deny, that had Pope never written
anything else, his name would not have been known as a name even of
promise, but would probably have been redeemed from oblivion by some
satirist or writer of a Dunciad."<a name="FNanchor_10_725" id="FNanchor_10_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_725" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "Expanding judgment" is often a
feeble antidote to the partiality of an author for his own compositions,
and Pope always spoke of his Pastoral effusions with fond complacency.
He did, indeed, pretend to regret their publication. There was some
delay in bringing out the Miscellany, and on November 1, 1708, he wrote
thus to Cromwell: "But now I talk of the critics, I have good news to
tell you concerning myself, for which I expect you should congratulate
with me; it is, that beyond all my expectations, and far above my
demerits, I have been most mercifully reprieved by the sovereign power
of Jacob Tonson from being brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> forth to public punishment, and
[have been] respited from time to time from the hands of those barbarous
executioners of the muses, whom I was just now speaking of. It often
happens that guilty poets, like other guilty criminals, when once they
are known and proclaimed, deliver themselves into the hands of justice
only to prevent others from doing it more to their disadvantage, and not
out of any ambition to spread their fame by being executed in the face
of the world, which is a fame but of short continuance." Pope was in his
twenty-first year, an age at which frankness commonly preponderates, and
he already abounded in the ostentatious profession of sentiments he did
not entertain. He had circulated the Pastorals among numerous authors,
he had invited their criticisms, he had continued to correct the poems
with fastidious care, he retained to the last a high opinion of their
merit, and it is impossible to credit his insinuation, that he did not
design them for the press, and that he only printed them to avoid a
surreptitious edition which nobody gave any sign of preparing. The
hypocrisy broke out again when the Miscellany had appeared. "Nothing,"
wrote Wycherley, May 17, 1709, "has lately been better received by the
public than your part of it. You have only displeased the critics by
pleasing them too well, having not left them a word to say for
themselves against you and your performances. In earnest, all the best
judges of good sense or poetry are admirers of yours, and like your part
of the book so well that the rest is liked the worse." Pope replied, "I
shall be satisfied if I can lose my time agreeably this way, without
losing my reputation. As for gaining any, I am as indifferent in the
matter as Falstaff was, and may say of fame as he did of honour, 'If it
comes, it comes unlooked for; and there's an end on't.'" This
affectation of indifference was kept up by him to the end of his days.
Yet he was all the time composing, polishing, and publishing; his whole
existence was passed in painstaking, and almost drudging authorship; he
left no means untried, dishonest as well as fair, to sustain, extend,
and perpetuate his reputation; and he pursued every person with
inveterate malice who presumed to question his poetical supremacy. In
spite of his boasted apathy, there cannot be found in the annals of the
irritable race a more anxious, jealous, intriguing candidate for fame.</p>

<p>In his letter to Wycherley, Walsh remarked of Pope's Pastorals, "It is
no flattery at all to say that Virgil had written nothing so good at his
age." Walsh must have been thinking of Virgil's Eclogues, which are his
most juvenile productions, though he is not supposed to have commenced
them till he was thirty years old. Pope admired them to excess, and in
his manhood he held to the belief that "it was difficult to find any
fault in them."<a name="FNanchor_11_726" id="FNanchor_11_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_726" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> His desire was to repeat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> with slight variations,
this ancient pattern, which he thought perfection. Virgil himself was a
plagiarist, but the Eclogues have more originality than the Pastorals.
The descriptions of both Virgil and Pope are artificial, but Virgil has
heart-felt touches from the life, of which the Pastorals afford no
trace. The taste of both was unformed, but the conceits of Virgil are
accompanied by a poetic vein which was not yet equally developed in
Pope. Since the Pastorals are an imitation of the Eclogues, it might be
expected, as usually happens in such cases, that the copy would have the
defects of the model in an exaggerated degree. Pope could not disguise
from himself that his verses were the echo of an echo; and in a letter
of July 2, 1706, he begged Walsh to tell him sincerely whether he had
not stretched the license of borrowing too far. Walsh admitted in his
answer, that some persons to whom he had shown the manuscript had made
this objection, but he professed not to share it, and comforted his
friend by the assurance, "that in all the common subjects of poetry the
thoughts are so obvious that whoever writes last must write things like
what have been said before." Roscoe has repeated the plea, and speaks of
"the unreasonableness" of expecting new images on a topic which "has
been the general theme of poetry in every country, period, and
language." He forgot that rural scenery and life had furnished abundant
novelty to Thomson, Cowper, Wordsworth, and Crabbe, whose pictures are
as fresh and unhacknied as if Theocritus and Virgil had never lived. "He
that walks behind," said Michael Angelo "can never go before;" and
originality was impossible when Pope's only notion of legitimate
pastoral was a slavish mimicry of classical remains. Had he drawn his
materials from the English landscape before his eyes, from the English
characters about his doors, and from the English usages and modes of
thought in his own day, he would have discovered a thousand particulars
in which he had not been anticipated by Greeks and Romans. He neglected
this inexhaustible territory, and bestowed so little attention upon the
realities around him, that though his descriptions are confined to the
barest generalities, they are not unfrequently false.</p>

<p>After contending that the triteness of the Pastorals was inevitable,
Roscoe puts forth a second defence to save the precocity of their
author. "The observation," he says, "of Johnson, that no invention was
intended, is, as far as the remark of Warton affects the genius and
character of Pope, a decisive answer." This must mean that he copied
from choice, and not from necessity, which is contradicted by the
confession of Pope himself, who acknowledges that he leant upon his
masters because he was unable to go alone.<a name="FNanchor_12_727" id="FNanchor_12_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_727" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Without his testimony we
should have been driven to the same conclusion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> since every great poet
whose youthful verses have been preserved, began by imitating his
predecessors, and it would be absurd, in defiance of a general law, to
assume that Pope was gifted with a juvenile originality which his early
works belie. If he had been capable of higher flights, it would have
done him no honour to have employed his melodious verse in piecing
together stale, vapid, and often paltry ideas.</p>

<p>Johnson, to be sure, was of opinion that Pope in his Pastorals had
copied "the poems of antiquity with judicious selection," but this
approbation he does not seem to deserve. A large volume might be
composed consisting solely of faults which had their counterpart in
works of genius. The homage Pope paid to famous names seduced his
immature taste into the admiration of many a vicious passage, and he
endeavoured to emulate or outdo the frigid and hyperbolical conceits of
his prototypes. Throughout the Pastorals, for instance, the phenomena,
which are the effects of the seasons, are ascribed to the presence or
absence of the nymphs whom his minstrels celebrate. In spring, the skies
mourn in showers, the birds are hushed, and the flowers are closed till
Delia smiles, when forthwith the skies brighten, the flowers bloom, and
the birds sing. In summer, the shepherd boasts that the breezes shall
wait upon his heroine, and blow in the places where she walks; that the
trees where she sits shall crowd into a shade; that the flowers shall
rise up from the soil where she treads; and that vegetation shall
flourish where she turns her eyes. In autumn, the birds neglect their
song, the leaves fall from the trees, and the flowers droop because
Delia has gone away. In winter, the heavens are obscured by clouds, the
verdure has withered, the flocks refuse to graze the meadows, the bees
neglect their honey, and the streams overflow with tears because Daphne
is dead. This last pastoral, which was Pope's favourite, turns mainly on
the notion that winter is the consequence of heaven and earth deploring
the death of Mrs. Tempest. "Such," says Sandys, "is the sweetness and
power of poesy, as it makes that appear which were in prose both false
and ridiculous, to resemble the truth." Poetic fancy is separated from
extravagance by narrow boundaries; but there must be some affinity to
truth, or the understanding is repelled instead of the imagination being
captivated. No ideas can have less to recommend them than the hollow
rhapsodies of the Pastorals, for they are at once obvious and absurd.
"Poetry," said Wordsworth, "is the image of man and nature," and Pope's
fantastic superlatives are the image of neither. They never approximate
to the exaggeration of fervid passion, but both grief and love are
without the semblance of genuine feeling, and only excited the derision
of those who looked for a meaning beneath the glitter of words. "Pray
tell me the name of him I love," wrote Lady Mary Pierrepont, afterwards
the celebrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> Lady Mary Wortley, "that I may sigh to the woods and
groves hereabouts, and teach it to the echo. Above all, let me know
whether it is most proper to walk in the woods, increasing the winds
with my sighs, or to sit by a purling stream, swelling the rivulet with
my tears."<a name="FNanchor_13_728" id="FNanchor_13_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_728" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This happy ridicule of a style of composition, which Pope
acknowledged ought "to be full of the greatest simplicity, in nature,"
was written a few months after the Pastorals were published, and appears
to have been suggested by them. The clever girl drew her notions from
life, and the perceptions of the young author were sophisticated by
books. Bowles believed that Pope was influenced "by the false taste of
Cowley at that time prevalent." Cowley's popularity, however, had ceased
for some years; the fashion he set had passed away; and Dryden reigned
in his stead. "He is sunk in his reputation," said this illustrious
successor in 1700, "because he could never forego any conceit which came
in his way, but swept, like a drag-net, great and small. For this
reason, though he must always be thought a great poet, he is no longer
esteemed a good writer, and for ten impressions which his works have had
in many successive years, yet at present a hundred books are scarcely
purchased once a twelvemonth."<a name="FNanchor_14_729" id="FNanchor_14_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_729" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The conceits in Pope's Pastorals were
derived from other sources. He took little from Cowley, and borrowed
none of his peculiarities.</p>

<p>Pope says, in his Discourse, that his Pastorals "have as much variety in
respect of the several seasons as Spenser's; that to add to this
variety, the several times of the day are observed, the rural
employments in each season or time of day, and the rural scenes or
places proper to such employments, not without some regard to the
several ages of man, and the different passions proper to each age."
Johnson has in consequence accorded to the Pastorals the praise of being
composed with "close thought;" but the conception was very imperfectly
executed, and in part is puerile. Spring and morning, summer and noon,
autumn and evening, winter and night, are coupled together, as if each
season was specially characterised by a single portion of the day,
selected for no other reason than because the order of succession is the
same. Between the several ages of man, and the seasons, there is an
obvious resemblance, which has furnished similes from time immemorial,
but there is no propriety in peopling a spring scene with children, and
a winter scene with the old, since all ages figure together in the
world, and manifest the feelings which belong to their years, whether it
happens to be winter or spring. If the plan had any merit, Pope did not
conform to it. The shepherds who sing in spring are grown up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> The
shepherd who sings in summer is a boy. Winter is a funereal lament for a
young lady who was cut off in her prime, and has not the most distant
reference to old age. The different passions proper to each time of
life, which Pope professes to have distinguished, are altogether
overlooked. Love is the sole passion which animates the actors in
Spring, Summer, and Autumn; and the shepherd in Winter celebrates the
departed Daphne in the same lover-like rhapsodies which prevail
throughout the three preceding poems. The rural employments proper to
each season have been equally forgotten. Sheep-keeping and verse-making
are the only occupations, though the poet declares he had changed the
scene to suit the changing employment, and represents the first pastoral
as sung in a valley, the second on the banks of a stream, the third on a
hill, and the fourth in a grove. In place of the variety to which he
lays claim, we have a general sameness, and if he had kept faithfully to
the outline he sketched, he would, with his mode of composition, have
done little towards diversifying the series. He wanted the "intimate
acquaintance with those minute and particular appearances of nature
which," as Bowles says, "can alone give a lively and original colour to
the painting of pastoral poetry." The scenes of his four lays,&mdash;the
valley, the stream, the hill, and the grove,&mdash;are just mentioned, and
nothing more. There is no attempt to depict them to the mind, and it
does not contribute to variety simply to tell the reader that he is now
in a valley, and now upon a hill. The seasons themselves are only marked
by the superficial, notorious circumstances which convey no pleasure in
the repetition, unless they are accompanied by the nice discriminating
touches of an exact observer. To say that showers descend, that birds
sing, that crocuses blow, and that trees put forth their leaves in
spring, supplies the mind with no fresh ideas, nor assists in giving a
new beauty and a more definite form to the ideas we possessed before.
The genius of Pope was in another direction; and when we contrast the
picturesque details of Thomson's Seasons with the blank common-places of
the Pastorals, we perceive how wide is the interval between the elegant,
harmonious versifier, and the genuine poet of nature. Sheep are twice
mentioned in Pope's Winter, once at ver. 5,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now sleeping flocks in their soft fleeces lie;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and again at ver. 37,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For her the flocks refuse their verdant food.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Widely different in life and vividness are the lines in which Thomson
paints the flocks under their true wintry aspect, when the snow is
falling, and has buried up the herbage.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">The bleating kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eye the bleak heaven, and next the glist'ning earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With looks of dumb despair.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></div></div>

<p>In a verse which is not original, but which is more descriptive than
usual, Pope speaks of the breezes which, in spring, blow gently among
the osiers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is flat by the side of the passage in Thomson's Spring, where he
describes the effects of the lightest current of air upon the aspen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i27">Not a breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is heard to quiver through the closing woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rustling turn the many-twinkling leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of aspen tall.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The epithet "closing" is happily applied to woods just bursting into
foliage, and the epithet "many-twinkling" is exquisitely appropriate to
the leaves of the aspen, which, when every other tree is still, and the
air can hardly be felt to stir, dance up and down incessantly, with an
endless play of light and shadow, and rustle as they wave joyously to
and fro. Nature scarce affords a prettier sight, or a more soothing
sound. These comparisons might be extended through pages, and they are
fair examples of Pope's inferiority in a style which was unsuited to his
turn of mind, and of which he had never formed adequate ideas.</p>

<p>Roscoe could perceive no impropriety in transferring classical customs
and mythology to the plains of Windsor. He conceived that every
objection was obviated by the announcement of Pope, "that pastoral is an
image of the golden age," which leaves us to infer, that during this
happy interlude our British shepherds adopted the manners and religion
of Greece. But the golden age was itself an exploded fable, which had
lost its hold on the imagination, and even if Englishmen in the
eighteenth century could have been beguiled by the dream, they could not
at least have been enthralled by the fiction, that Paradise was renewed
in England under the auspices of heathenism. The theory of a golden age
introduced a second inconsistency into the Pastorals without remedying
the first. Bad as is the defence, it cannot be pleaded on Pope's behalf;
for discarding in his Winter the notion of some remote and undefined
era, he has laid the scene in a particular year of the reign of Queen
Anne, and makes Lycidas declare that he will often sacrifice a lamb to
the deceased Mrs. Tempest, who died in 1703. There are several other
incongruities. "Zodiac" is too hard a term to be remembered correctly by
one of Pope's shepherds, a circumstance which is intended to denote the
little learning he possessed; and the same ignorant shepherd proceeds to
talk as glibly of Hybla, and Cynthus, and Idalia'a groves as if they had
been neighbouring parishes.</p>

<p>One characteristic of the Pastorals has been universally allowed&mdash;the
peculiar softness of the versification, which was considered by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> Pope to
be an essential quality of this species of composition. He told Spence
that he had scarce ever bestowed more labour in tuning his lines.<a name="FNanchor_15_730" id="FNanchor_15_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_730" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He
must have had less facility when he was learning the art than when he
was thoroughly practised in it; and since authors are apt to estimate
the result by the amount of toil it has cost them, the greater pains he
expended upon his early efforts may have been the reason that "he
esteemed the Pastorals as the most correct in the versification, and
musical in the numbers, of all his works." He certainly went forwards in
some of his later pieces. Windsor Forest, and the Epistle of Eloisa to
Abelard, are finer specimens of melody than the Pastorals. The poetic
harmony displayed by Pope in his youth refuted an axiom which Dryden
propounded in his lines to the memory of Oldham.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O early ripe! to thy abundant store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could advancing age have added more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might, what nature never gives the young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have taught the smoothness of thy native tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But satire needs not this, and wit will shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many examples might be quoted in support of Dryden's position, but he
had failed to discover, what the later history of poetry has rendered
clear, that where there is not a defective ear, the softness or
ruggedness of juvenile verses depends upon the model. The imitative
faculty of boyhood is never more at home than in catching the trick of
metrical harmony. Dryden had used the heroic measure with consummate
skill, and no one who came after him could fall into the "harsh cadence"
of Oldham's Satires, and Cowley's Davideis, or rest satisfied with the
combination of rough and smooth in the productions of Sandys and Denham.
The music of the "mighty master" was on every tongue when Pope began "to
lisp in numbers." "I learned versification," he said to Spence, "wholly
from Dryden's works, who had improved it much beyond any of our former
poets; and would, probably, have brought it to its perfection, had not
he been unhappily obliged to write so often in haste."<a name="FNanchor_16_731" id="FNanchor_16_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_731" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> What Dryden
did for Pope, Pope did for the next generation, and to compose
mellifluous verses became the common attainment of ordinary scribblers.
Cowper, in his Table Talk, has specially noticed this effect of Pope's
writings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he (his musical finesse was such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So nice his ear, so delicate his touch)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made poetry a mere mechanic art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every warbler has his tune by heart.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In metrical skill Pope was thought by most persons to have surpassed all
his predecessors. "He is the most harmonious poet,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> said Voltaire,
"that England ever had. He has reduced the sharp hissings of the English
trumpet to the sweet sounds of the flute."<a name="FNanchor_17_732" id="FNanchor_17_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_732" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Voltaire doubtless found
this opinion prevalent in the circle he frequented during his residence
in England, from 1720 to 1728; for his own knowledge of our language
would not have enabled him to distinguish the nicer shades of melody.
The English critics confirm his decision. Johnson declared that the
versification of the Pastorals had "no precedent, nor has since had an
imitation." Warton pronounced "that it was musical to a degree of which
rhyme could hardly be thought capable," and Bowles admitted that Pope
"had made the English couplet infinitely more smooth." To the few who
"censured his poetry as too uniformly musical, and as glutting the ear
with unvaried sweetness," Johnson replied, "I suspect this objection to
be the cant of those who judge by principles rather than perception; and
who would even themselves have less pleasure in his works, if he had
tried to relieve attention by studied discords, or affected to break his
lines, and vary his pauses."<a name="FNanchor_18_733" id="FNanchor_18_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_733" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Bowles sided with the cavillers, as
Johnson deemed them, and held that the want of breaks and of variety in
the pauses produced a monotony of sound. Lord Kames, on the contrary,
asserted that Pope was "eminent for variety of versification," and that
the variety of his pauses was the source of the "variety of his
melody."<a name="FNanchor_19_734" id="FNanchor_19_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_734" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> I agree with the dissentients who think that his metre is
prone to a cloying mannerism, but I believe that the defect is ascribed
by Bowles to the wrong cause. Any one who compares the imperial march of
the metre in the Vanity of Human Wishes, with the sweet, but less
majestic Deserted Village, will perceive that the swell of the heroic
measure is capable of wide degrees. A poet judges of the harmony of his
verses by trying them on his ear, and the tendency is to set them all to
the same tune. This was Pope's error. He has in general, though not
always, intermixed the pauses, but he has not varied sufficiently the
swell and movement of his lines. Dryden, "in whose admirable ear," as
Gray remarks, "the music of our old versification still sounded,"<a name="FNanchor_20_735" id="FNanchor_20_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_735" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
rings the changes with wonderful ease and spirit, and is by turns soft
and stately, lively and solemn, familiar and sonorous, while he
preserves through all his transitions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> a freedom, a flow, and an
elasticity which never flag. His negligent lines, which are often
imputed to haste, have been thought by good writers to be intended to
avoid the surfeit of an equable strain. "Sometimes," says Dr. Trapp, "it
is not only allowable, but beautiful, to run into harsh and unequal
numbers. Mr. Dryden himself does it; and we may be sure he knew when he
did it as well as we could tell him. In a work intended for pleasure,
variety justifies the breach of almost any rule, provided it be done but
rarely."<a name="FNanchor_21_736" id="FNanchor_21_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_736" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> There is extreme exaggeration in the language of Bowles
when he states that Pope "gave the first idea of mellifluence." Lines as
melodious may be counted in Dryden by the hundred. Pope only maintained
a more continuous softness, or, as Johnson puts it, "he discovered, by
perusing the works of Dryden, the most perfect fabric of English verse,
and habituated himself to that only which he found the best."<a name="FNanchor_22_737" id="FNanchor_22_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_737" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This
constantly recurring note, however attractive in itself, must always
appear a retrograde system, to those who appreciate the richer music of
more diversified modulations. The sameness of Pope's metre was the
reason that "every warbler had his tune by heart," and imitated it so
readily. There was a complexity in the incessant rise and fall of
Dryden's lines which mechanical verse-makers could only copy
imperfectly. The uniformity of Pope gave them little trouble. The
repetition soon fixed the brief lesson in their minds, and the petty
warblers almost rivalled their original in sound, though they were far
enough from approaching the beauty of his language, the terseness of his
style, the felicity of his ideas, and the weight of his sense.</p>

<p>As the Pastorals of Philips opened the sixth volume of Tonson's
Miscellany, De Quiucey conjectures that Pope's Pastorals may have been
placed at the end of the volume by his own desire. Both sets of verses,
by this arrangement, were more likely to attract attention, and invite
comparison. Pope appears not to have felt any jealousy at the outset.
Speaking of Philips's Pastorals in a letter to Cromwell, on October 28,
1710, a year and a half after the Miscellany was published, he said "he
agreed with the Tatler that we had no better eclogues in our language."
He particularly commended the lines which describe the musician playing
on the harp, and added that "nothing could be objected to them, except
that they were too lofty for pastoral." He changed his tone after the
essays on pastoral poetry had appeared in the Guardian. These papers
commenced with No. 22, and in No. 23, for April 7, 1713, some passages
are quoted from Philips to illustrate the qualities appropriate to the
pastoral style. In No. 30 there are more quotations from Philips to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> the
same purpose, and he and Spenser are singled out as the sole cultivators
of this species of composition, who "have copied and improved the
beauties of the ancients." The eulogium reached its climax in No. 32,
where it is asserted that there have been only four true masters of the
art in above two thousand years,&mdash;"Theocritus, who left his dominions to
Virgil; Virgil, who left his to his son Spenser; and Spenser, who was
succeeded by his eldest born Philips." It is not known who contributed
the essays, but it has been conjectured, without any evidence, that they
proceeded from Tickell. There cannot be a question that the author had a
friendship for Philips, or he would not have ranked him with Theocritus,
Virgil, and Spenser; and it is equally certain that he was not an
admirer of the Pastorals of Pope, which are passed over in silence, and
which violate the canons laid down by the critic. "I must observe," he
says, "that our countrymen have so good an opinion of the ancients, and
think so modestly of themselves, that the generality of pastoral writers
have either stolen all from the Greeks and Romans, or so servilely
imitated their manners and customs as makes them very ridiculous."<a name="FNanchor_23_738" id="FNanchor_23_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_738" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The method of Philips is adduced in advantageous contrast. He is
commended for changing the details with the scene, and introducing
English ideas into English eclogues. A few months earlier similar praise
had been bestowed upon him by Addison, in the Spectator for October 30,
1712. "When we are at school," said Addison in his essay, "it is
necessary for us to be acquainted with the system of pagan theology, and
we may be allowed to enliven a theme or point an epigram with a heathen
god; but no thought is beautiful which is not just, and no thought can
be just which is not founded in truth, or at least in that which passes
for such. If any are of opinion that there is a necessity of admitting
these classical legends into our serious compositions, in order to give
them a more poetical turn, I would recommend to their consideration the
Pastorals of Mr. Philips. One would have thought it impossible for this
kind of poetry to have subsisted without fauns and satyrs, wood-nymphs
and water-nymphs, with all the tribe of rural deities. But we see he has
given a new life, and a more natural beauty, to this way of writing, by
substituting in the place of these antiquated fables the superstitious
mythology which prevails among the shepherds of our own country."
Addison had previously commenced the reformation by excluding pagan
machinery from his Campaign. It needed but a small amount of taste to
share his opinions, and the writer in the Guardian can hardly be charged
with hostility to Pope for not commending Pastorals which, apart from
their melodious language, were little better than a medley of unnatural
compliments, and unmeaning mythology.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> Contemporary criticism is more
often corrupted by the kindness of friendship than by the spite of
enmity, but the effect is sometimes the same, and the undue exaltation
of Philips increased the comparative contempt which was cast upon Pope.
He had reason to be annoyed, and it was not much compensation that the
prettiest lines of his January and May were quoted in one of the papers
on Pastoral, to show that fairies could be rendered attractive in verse.</p>

<p>The scheme Pope devised for redressing the wrong, was to send a paper to
the Guardian in which he ridiculed the Pastorals of his rival and
applauded his own. "With an unexampled and unequalled artifice of
irony," says Dr. Johnson, "though he himself has always the advantage,
he gives the preference to Philips." In the opening sentence of the
essay Pope is described as "a gentleman whose character it is, that he
takes the greatest care of his works before they are published, and the
least concern for them afterwards."<a name="FNanchor_24_739" id="FNanchor_24_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_739" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He followed his invariable habit
of boasting his pre-eminence in the very virtue he was defying, and
attached this vaunt to a criticism in which his morbid "concern" for his
works had induced him to become his own reviewer and eulogist. He was
liberal in his self-laudation, and assured the public that though his
Pastorals might not fulfil the strict definition laid down in the
Guardian, they were, like Virgil's, "something better." To prove the
inferiority of Philips he selected three of his worst passages, and
contrasted them with three of his own. He picked out a dozen foolish
lines from his rival, and alleged that they were specimens of his
ordinary manner. He subjoined some ludicrous imitations of his style,
which are only not an outrageous caricature because they have no
resemblance at all to the original. The faults of Philips did not
require to be exaggerated. The absurdities of his satirist are different
in kind, but they are not less in degree. Some defects they had in
common, and as self-love is blind, Pope did not perceive that most of
his comments recoiled upon himself. He objected that Philips had
introduced wolves into England, where they formerly existed, and the
critic forgot that the imaginary golden age, which he maintained in his
Discourse was the only era of Pastoral, must be assigned to a period
long anterior to their extirpation. Or if the piping shepherds, who
composed and chanted poems, were to be considered as existing
personages, credibility was not more violated in supposing that Windsor
Forest was still haunted by wolves than by heathen gods and
goddesses,&mdash;in imagining the lambs to be preyed upon by a wild beast,
than in picturing Christian bards employed in sacrificing them to Mrs.
Tempest with an exact observance of pagan rites. He took especial credit
for having kept to the circumstances proper to a particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> season of
the year, and a certain time of the day, and exposed the ignorance of
Philips, who, says he, "by a poetical creation, hath raised up finer
beds of flowers than the most industrious gardener; his roses, lilies,
and daffodils blow in the same season." Pope might have remembered that
in his own Pastorals he had made roses, violets, and crocuses bloom
together, which drew from George Steevens the remark, that he has rarely
mentioned flowers without some mistake of the kind. The nicest observers
of nature are not exempt from these oversights. The swine in Ivanhoe
feed on acorns under the trees in the middle of summer, and though
Walter Scott, at the end of the Monastery, alluded playfully to the
anachronism, he never cared to correct the error. A more important
charge, in which Pope is most of all open to retaliation, was that
Philip's Pastorals "gave manifest proof of his knowledge of books."
While it was admitted that "his competitor had imitated some single
thoughts of the ancients," Philips was held up as a wholesale
depredator. He does, indeed, abound in the stock ideas which had served
a hundred versifiers. He is a warbler who whistles an old tune, but he
is not without a few notes which have a semblance of originality, and
these are wanting in his accuser. Inferior to the Pastorals of Pope in
polish and versification, the Pastorals of Philips are, on the whole,
superior in their substance. The trial of skill between the musician and
the nightingale, which forms the subject of the fifth Pastoral, is
narrated with singular sweetness, and may still be read with pleasure.
In true poetic feeling it is much beyond anything in the Pastorals of
his scoffing critic. Philips owed his advantage to his maturer years,
and not to the brilliancy of his talents; he was thirty-four when
Tonson's Miscellany appeared, and Pope was but twenty-one. The powers of
Philips remained stationary, and he ranks low among the minor poets.
Pope quickly ripened into genius, and reigned without a competitor. The
exaggerated panegyrics of the Guardian could not confer a reputation
upon Philips he did not deserve, and Pope derived none of his celebrity
from the gross expedient of exalting himself, and decrying his
antagonist. There is nothing which is less affected by unjust praise and
unjust detraction than an author's works. They are there to speak for
themselves, and no amount of petty artifices can long raise them higher
or sink them lower than they merit.</p>

<p>Pope was a contributor to the Guardian, and on cordial terms with the
editor, but he could not ask to have a paper inserted in which he had
drawn a comparison between his own Pastorals and those of his rival, and
awarded himself the palm. He therefore sent the criticism anonymously,
and Steele, as we are told by Warburton, not discovering that the praise
of Philips and the censure of Pope were both ironical, showed the
manuscript to the latter, and assured him that he would "never publish
any paper where one of the club<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> was complimented at the expense of
another." His ingenuous ally affected magnanimity, and prevailed upon
Steele to print the essay. The irony which could not be detected by the
wits at Button's might well escape less cultivated minds. Ayre, in his
Memoirs of Pope, in 1745, and Dilworth, in 1760, both believed that the
criticism was to be interpreted literally, that Steele was the author of
it, and that it was dictated by friendship for Philips. Small as was the
ability of these biographers, they may be supposed to have shared the
common opinion. This continued to be the accepted doctrine in the next
generation; and the celebrated circle in which Hannah More lived were
unanimous in holding that the essay was not satirical. "The whole
criticism," she wrote August 4, 1783, "appears to me a burlesque, but I
have some reason to think I am in the wrong, as I have all the world
against me. That a writer of so pure a taste could be in earnest when he
talks of the elegance of Diggon Davy, and exalts all that trash of
Philips's, whose simplicity is silliness, I cannot bring myself to
believe." She found it still more difficult to believe that the author
could be serious in asserting that Hobbinol and Lobbin are names
agreeable to the delicacy of an English ear.<a name="FNanchor_25_740" id="FNanchor_25_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_740" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Hannah More judged of
Philips by the wretched extracts in the Guardian. Her accomplished
friends could hardly have admired them; and it must have been for a
different reason that the purpose of the essay was misunderstood. Warton
says that the misapprehension arose from "the skill with which the irony
was conducted." It would be more natural to infer that the execution was
defective when the vast majority of literary men mistook the design. The
satire, in fact, is imperfectly sustained, and passages, which the
author intended for irony, appeared to the reader to be plain common
sense. "Mr. Pope," he says of himself, "hath fallen into the same error
with Virgil. His names are borrowed from Theocritus and Virgil, which
are improper to the scenes of his Pastorals. He introduces Daphnis,
Alexis, and Thyrsis on British plains, as Virgil had done before him on
the Mantuan." Habit had reconciled Pope to the affectation of calling
English shepherds Daphnis and Thyrsis, but "the names," as De Quincey
says, "are rank with childishness," and the public, who felt the
practice to be absurd, concluded that the censure was real. "It may,"
said Pope, "be observed, as a farther beauty of this pastoral, that the
words nymph, dryad, naiad, faun, Cupid, or satyr, are not once mentioned
through the whole," which was a sneer at Addison's commendation of
Philips for rejecting those dreary nonentities; but the public, who had
been nauseated with them, could not detect a covert sarcasm in the
repetition of the praise by the writer in the Guardian. The circumstance
which seemed to Warton to render the irony transparent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> was the remark,
that "Philips had with great judgment described wolves in England," but
the ridicule was based upon ignorance, and must have been lost upon
every one who was aware that wolves abounded in the antique period to
which the pastorals referred. Bowles, who knew that the paper was
ironical, yet imagined that Pope was serious in the opening portion,
where it is asserted that Virgil has not above a couple of "true
pastorals," and that Theocritus has scarcely more. This part, however,
of the essay was in the same sarcastic vein with the rest. The previous
critic in the Guardian had laid down the rule that a pastoral should
reflect "the golden age of innocence," and Pope, to deprive Philips of
the benefit of the definition, endeavoured to show that Theocritus and
Virgil had hardly ever conformed to it. He did not mean seriously to
admit that his competitor was a more genuine pastoral poet than Virgil
and Theocritus. His object was to throw ridicule on the definition
itself, albeit he adopted it in his Discourse on Pastoral Poetry when he
was no longer engaged in disparaging Philips.</p>

<p>Nothing can be clearer than that Pope was instigated to write the essay
in the Guardian by his jealousy of the praise which had been bestowed
upon his rival. The course he took was discreditable, and Warburton,
without attempting a direct apology, pretends that the incident which
influenced the poet was the misrepresentations made of him to Addison by
Philips. Ruffhead adds that the calumny consisted in the assertion that
Pope was "engaged in the intrigues of the tory ministry." This would be
a good reason for his exposing the mis-statement, but would be a poor
excuse for his writing an anonymous attack upon Philips's Pastorals, and
a panegyric upon his own. The defence, which would be inadequate if it
was true, is indubitably incorrect. The account of Warburton did not
appear till Philips was dead. Pope, while Philips was living, published
an account, in the shape of a letter to Caryll, the date and contents of
which prove that Philips did not bring his charge against Pope till a
full year after the paper had been printed in the Guardian.<a name="FNanchor_26_741" id="FNanchor_26_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_741" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The poet
adds that when they meet he will inform Caryll "of the secret grounds of
Philips's malignity," and Warburton himself subjoins in a note "These
grounds were Mr. Pope's writing the ironical comparison between his own
and Philips's Pastorals." The strong presumption from the nature of the
case that Pope was actuated by literary envy is thus confirmed. The
criticism in the Guardian was not provoked by the malignity of Philips,
but the bitterness of Philips was the consequence of the criticism. In
1790, Mr. J. C. Walker, the Italian scholar, sent to the Gentleman's
Magazine an alleged remark of Philips to the same effect. "When the
comparison," says Mr. Walker, "between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> Pastorals of Pope and
Philips appeared, Philips was secretary to Primate Boulter, and then in
Ireland. Dining one day with the officers of the Prerogative Court, the
comparison became the subject of conversation, and Philips said he knew
it was written by Pope, adding, 'I wonder why the little crooked bastard
should attack me, who never offended him either in word or deed?' This I
had from a gentleman who was present."<a name="FNanchor_27_742" id="FNanchor_27_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_742" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> If the conversation ever
occurred, the gentleman was mistaken in supposing that the criticism was
recent, for the paper in the Guardian came out in 1713, and it was not
till more than ten years afterwards that Philips went with Archbishop
Boulter to Ireland. The story is unnecessary to prove that Pope was the
aggressor, which is sufficiently evident from independent testimony.
Unhappily for himself, he began at the outset of his career to stir up
those enmities which were the torment of his existence. By his attack
upon Dennis, in the Essay on Criticism, he invited the scurrility of
that rabid pamphleteer, and by what Bowles calls his "unmanly hostility"
to Philips he was reduced to the shame of being scared away from
Button's by the no less unmanly retaliation of his victim, who, at some
period of the quarrel, hung up a birch, and declared that he would use
it on "his rival Arcadian," if he showed his face in the coffee-room.</p>

<h2>A DISCOURSE</h2>

<h4>ON</h4>

<h2>PASTORAL POETRY.<a name="FNanchor_1_743" id="FNanchor_1_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_743" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>There are not, I believe, a greater number of any sort of verses than of
those which are called pastorals; nor a smaller, than of those which are
truly so. It therefore seems necessary to give some account of this kind
of poem; and it is my design to comprise in this short paper the
substance of those numerous dissertations the critics have made on the
subject, without omitting any of their rules in my own favour. You will
also find some points reconciled, about which they seem to differ, and a
few remarks, which, I think, have escaped their observation.</p>

<p>The original of poetry is ascribed to that age which succeeded the
creation of the world: and as the keeping of flocks seems to have been
the first employment of mankind, the most ancient sort of poetry was
probably pastoral.<a name="FNanchor_2_744" id="FNanchor_2_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_744" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is natural to imagine, that the leisure of
those ancient shepherds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> admitting and inviting some diversion, none was
so proper to that solitary and sedentary life as singing; and that in
their songs they took occasion to celebrate their own felicity. From
hence a poem was invented, and afterwards improved to a perfect image of
that happy time; which, by giving us an esteem for the virtues of a
former age, might recommend them to the present. And since the life of
shepherds was attended with more tranquillity than any other rural
employment, the poets chose to introduce their persons, from whom it
received the name of pastoral.</p>

<p>A pastoral is an imitation of the action of a shepherd, or one
considered under that character. The form of this imitation is dramatic,
or narrative, or mixed of both<a name="FNanchor_3_745" id="FNanchor_3_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_745" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; the fable simple; the manners not too
polite nor too rustic: the thoughts are plain, yet admit a little
quickness and passion, but that short and flowing: the expression
humble, yet as pure as the language will afford; neat, but not florid;
easy, and yet lively. In short, the fable, manners, thoughts, and
expressions are full of the greatest simplicity in nature.</p>

<p>The complete character of this poem consists in simplicity<a name="FNanchor_4_746" id="FNanchor_4_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_746" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, brevity,
and delicacy; the two first of which render an eclogue natural, and the
last delightful.</p>

<p>If we would copy nature, it may be useful to take this idea along with
us, that pastoral is an image of what they call the golden age. So that
we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really
are, but as they may be conceived then to have been; when the best of
men followed the employment.<a name="FNanchor_5_747" id="FNanchor_5_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_747" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> To carry this resemblance yet further,
it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> not be amiss to give these shepherds some skill in astronomy,
as far as it may be useful to that sort of life. And an air of piety to
the gods should shine through the poem, which so visibly appears in all
the works of antiquity; and it ought to preserve some relish of the old
way of writing; the connection should be loose, the narrations and
descriptions short,<a name="FNanchor_6_748" id="FNanchor_6_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_748" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the periods concise. Yet it is not
sufficient, that the sentences only be brief, the whole eclogue should
be so too. For we cannot suppose poetry in those days to have been the
business of men, but their recreation at vacant hours.<a name="FNanchor_7_749" id="FNanchor_7_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_749" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But with respect to the present age, nothing more conduces to make these
composures natural, than when some knowledge in rural affairs is
discovered.<a name="FNanchor_8_750" id="FNanchor_8_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_750" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This may be made to appear rather done by chance than on
design, and sometimes is best shown by inference; lest by too much study
to seem natural, we destroy that easy simplicity from whence arises the
delight. For what is inviting in this sort of poetry, as Fontenelle
observes, proceeds not so much from the idea of that business, as of the
tranquillity of a country life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>We must therefore use some illusion to render a pastoral delightful; and
this consists in exposing the best side only of a shepherd's life, and
in concealing its miseries.<a name="FNanchor_9_751" id="FNanchor_9_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_751" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Nor is it enough to introduce shepherds
discoursing together in a natural way: but a regard must be had to the
subject, that it contain some particular beauty in itself, and that it
be different in every eclogue. Besides, in each of them a designed scene
or prospect is to be presented to our view, which should likewise have
its variety.<a name="FNanchor_10_752" id="FNanchor_10_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_752" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This variety is obtained in a great degree by frequent
comparisons, drawn from the most agreeable objects of the country; by
interrogations to things inanimate; by beautiful digressions, but those
short; sometimes by insisting a little on circumstances; and lastly, by
elegant turns on the words, which render the numbers extremely sweet and
pleasing. As for the numbers themselves, though they are properly of the
heroic measure, they should be the smoothest, the most easy and flowing
imaginable.</p>

<p>It is by rules like these that we ought to judge of pastoral. And since
the instructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in
perfection, they must of necessity be derived from those in whom it is
acknowledged so to be. It is therefore from the practice of Theocritus
and Virgil (the only undisputed authors of pastoral) that the critics
have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it.</p>

<p>Theocritus excels all others in nature and simplicity. The subjects of
his Idyllia are purely pastoral; but he is not so exact in his persons,
having introduced reapers and fishermen<a name="FNanchor_11_753" id="FNanchor_11_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_753" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> as well as shepherds.<a name="FNanchor_12_754" id="FNanchor_12_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_754" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
He is apt to be too long in his descriptions, of which that of the cup
in the first pastoral is a remarkable instance.<a name="FNanchor_13_755" id="FNanchor_13_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_755" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In the manners he
seems a little defective, for his swains are sometimes abusive and
immodest, and perhaps too much inclining to rusticity; for instance, in
his fourth and fifth Idyllia. But it is enough that all others learnt
their excellencies from him, and that his dialect alone has a secret
charm in it, which no other could ever attain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Virgil, who copies Theocritus, refines upon his original;<a name="FNanchor_14_756" id="FNanchor_14_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_756" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and in all
points, where judgment is principally concerned, he is much superior to
his master. Though some of his subjects are not pastoral in themselves,
but only seem to be such, they have a wonderful variety in them,<a name="FNanchor_15_757" id="FNanchor_15_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_757" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
which the Greek was a stranger to.<a name="FNanchor_16_758" id="FNanchor_16_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_758" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He exceeds him in regularity and
brevity, and falls short of him in nothing but simplicity and propriety
of style; the first of which perhaps was the fault of his age, and the
last of his language.</p>

<p>Among the moderns, their success has been greatest who have most
endeavoured to make these ancients their pattern. The most considerable
genius appears in the famous Tasso, and our Spenser. Tasso in his Aminta
has far excelled all the pastoral writers, as in his Gierusalemme he has
outdone the epic poets of his country. But as this piece seems to have
been the original of a new sort of poem, the pastoral comedy, in Italy,
it cannot so well be considered as a copy of the ancients.<a name="FNanchor_17_759" id="FNanchor_17_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_759" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Spenser's
Calendar, in Mr. Dryden's opinion, is the most complete work of this
kind which any nation has produced ever since the time of Virgil.<a name="FNanchor_18_760" id="FNanchor_18_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_760" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Not but that he may be thought imperfect in some few points. His
Eclogues are somewhat too long, if we compare them with the
ancients.<a name="FNanchor_19_761" id="FNanchor_19_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_761" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> He is sometimes too allegorical, and treats of matters of
religion in a pastoral style, as the Mantuan had done before him. He has
employed the lyric measure, which is contrary to the practice of the old
poets. His stanza is not still the same, nor always well chosen. This
last may be the reason his expression is sometimes not concise enough:
for the tetrastic has obliged him to extend his sense to the length of
four lines, which would have been more closely confined in the couplet.</p>

<p>In the manners, thoughts, and characters, he comes near to Theocritus
himself; though, notwithstanding all the care he has taken, he is
certainly inferior in his dialect: for the Doric had its beauty and
propriety in the time of Theocritus; it was used in part of Greece, and
frequent in the mouths of many of the greatest persons, whereas the old
English and country phrases of Spenser were either entirely obsolete, or
spoken only by people of the lowest condition.<a name="FNanchor_20_762" id="FNanchor_20_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_762" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> As there is a
difference betwixt simplicity and rusticity, so the expression of simple
thoughts should be plain, but not clownish. The addition he has made of
a calendar to his Eclogues, is very beautiful; since by this, besides
the general moral of innocence and simplicity, which is common to other
authors of pastoral, he has one peculiar to himself; he compares human
life to the several seasons, and at once exposes to his readers a view
of the great and little worlds, in their various changes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> and
aspects.<a name="FNanchor_21_763" id="FNanchor_21_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_763" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Yet the scrupulous division of his pastorals into months,
has obliged him either to repeat the same description, in other words,
for three months together; or, when it was exhausted before, entirely to
omit it: whence it comes to pass that some of his Eclogues (as the
sixth, eighth, and tenth, for example) have nothing but their titles to
distinguish them. The reason is evident, because the year has not that
variety in it to furnish every month with a particular description, as
it may every season.</p>

<p>Of the following Eclogues I shall only say, that these four comprehend
all the subjects which the critics upon Theocritus and Virgil will allow
to be fit for pastoral: that they have as much variety of description,
in respect of the several seasons, as Spenser's: that in order to add to
this variety, the several times of the day are observed, the rural
employments in each season or time of day, and the rural scenes or
places proper to such employments; not without some regard to the
several ages of man, and the different passions proper to each age. But
after all, if they have any merit, it is to be attributed to some good
old authors, whose works as I had leisure to study, so I hope I have not
wanted care to imitate.</p>

This sensible and judicious discourse written at so early an age is a
more extraordinary production than the Pastorals that follow it. Our
author has chiefly drawn his observations from Rapin, Fontenelle, and
the preface to Dryden's Virgil. A translation of Rapin's Discourse had
been some years before prefixed to Creech's translation of Theocritus,
and is no extraordinary piece of criticism. And though Hume highly
praises the Discourse of Fontenelle, yet Dr. Hurd thinks it only rather
more tolerable than his Pastorals.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
Hume had said that there could not be a finer piece of criticism than
Fontenelle's Dissertation on Pastorals, but that the Pastorals
themselves displayed false taste, and did not exemplify the rules laid
down in the criticism.</p></div>

refer descriptions of a rural state to the golden age, nor can I
perceive that any writer has consistently preserved the Arcadian manners
and sentiments. The only reason that I have read on which this rule has
been founded is that, according to the customs of modern life, it is
improbable that shepherds should be capable of harmonious numbers, or
delicate sentiments; and therefore, the reader must exalt his ideas of
the pastoral character by carrying his thoughts back to the age in which
the care of herds and flocks was the employment of the wisest and
greatest men. These reasoners seem to have been led into their
hypothesis by considering pastoral, not in general, as a representation
of rural nature, and consequently as exhibiting the ideas and sentiments
of those, whoever they are, to whom the country affords pleasure or
employment, but simply as a dialogue or narrative of men actually
tending sheep, and busied in the lowest and most laborious offices; from
whence they very readily concluded, since characters must necessarily be
preserved, that either the sentiments must sink to the level of the
speakers, or the speakers must be raised to the height of the
sentiments. In consequence of these original errors, a thousand precepts
have been given, which have only contributed to perplex and
confound.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_749" id="Footnote_7_749"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_749"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Pope took this remark from Dr. Knightly Chetwood's Preface
to the Pastorals in Dryden's Virgil: "Not only the sentences should be
short and smart, but the whole piece should be so too, for poetry and
pastime was not the business of men's lives in those days, but only
their seasonable recreation after necessary hours." The rule is purely
fanciful. By continuing the same subject from week to week, a shepherd
could as easily find leisure to compose a single piece of a thousand
lines as ten pieces of a hundred lines each. Most of the laws of
pastoral poetry which Pope has collected are equally unfounded.</p></div>

</p><p>
Pope's definition of Pastoral is too confined. In fact, his Pastoral
Discourse seems made to fit <i>his</i> Pastorals. For the same reason he
would not class as a true Pastoral the most interesting of all Virgil's
Eclogues,&mdash;I mean the first, which is founded on fact, which has the
most tender and touching strokes of nature, and the plot of which is
entirely pastoral, being the complaint of a shepherd obliged to leave
the fields of his infancy, and yield the possession to soldiers and
strangers. Pope says, because it relates to soldiers, it is not
pastoral; but how little of a military cast is seen in it. The soldier
is mentioned, but only as far as was absolutely necessary, and always in
connection with the rural imagery from whence the most exquisite touches
are derived. Pope's pastoral ideas, with the exception of the Messiah,
seem to have been taken from the least interesting and poetic scenes of
the ancient eclogue,&mdash;the Wager, the Contest, the Riddle, the alternate
praises of Daphne or Delia, the common-place complaint of the lover, &amp;c.
The more interesting and picturesque subjects were excluded, as not
being properly pastoral according to his definition.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span>
</p><p>
In saying that Pope would not allow Virgil's first eclogue to be "a true
pastoral," Bowles refers to the paper in the Guardian, where the design
was to laugh at the strict definition which would exclude a poem from
the pastoral class on such frivolous grounds. In the same jesting tone,
Pope asserts that the third eclogue must be set aside, because it
introduces "calumny and railing, which are not proper to a state of
concord," and the eighth, because it has a shepherd "whom an inviting
precipice tempts to self-destruction."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_754" id="Footnote_12_754"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_754"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The tenth and twenty-first Idyll here alluded to contain
some of the most exquisite strokes of nature and true poetry anywhere to
be met with, as does the beautiful description of the carving on the
cup, which, indeed is not a cup, but a very large pastoral vessel or
cauldron.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_755" id="Footnote_13_755"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_755"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> In what does the great father of the pastoral excel all
others? In "simplicity, and nature." I admit with Pope, but more
particularly in one circumstance, which seems to have escaped general
attention, and that circumstance is the picturesque. Pope says he is too
long in his descriptions, particularly of the cup. Was not Pope, a
professed admirer of painting, aware that the description of that cup
contains touches of the most delightful and highly-finished landscape?
The old fisherman, and the broken rock in one scene; in another, the
beautiful contrast of the little boy weaving his rush-work, and so
intent on it, that he forgets the vineyard he was set to guard. We see
him in the foreground of the piece. Then there is his scrip, and the fox
eyeing it askance; the ripe and purple vineyard, and the other fox
treading down the grapes whilst he continues at his work. Add to these
circumstances the wild and beautiful Sicilian scenery, and where can
there be found more perfect landscapes in the works, which these
pictures peculiarly resemble, of Vernet or Gainsborough? Considered in
this view, how rich, wild, and various are the landscapes of the old
Sicilian, and we cannot but wonder that so many striking and original
traits should be passed over by a "youthful bard," who professed to
select from, and to copy the ancients.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_756" id="Footnote_14_756"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_756"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> He refines indeed so much, as to make him, on this very
account, much inferior to the beautiful simplicity of his
original.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_757" id="Footnote_15_757"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_757"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> It is difficult to conceive where is the "wonderful
variety" in Virgil's Eclogues which "the Greek was a stranger to." Many
of the more poetical parts of Virgil are copied literally from
Theocritus; but are weakened by being made more general, and often lose
much of their picturesque and poetical effect from that
circumstance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_759" id="Footnote_17_759"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_759"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The Aminta of Tasso is here erroneously mentioned by Pope
as the very first pastoral comedy that appeared in Italy. But it is
certain that Il Sacrificio of Agostino Beccari was the first, who boasts
of it in his prologue, and who died very old in 1590.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
"There were," says Roscoe, "several writers of pastoral in Italy prior
to those mentioned either by Pope or Warton." Roscoe mistook the
question, which was, who was the first author of the pastoral <i>drama</i>?
None of the prior pastoral writers he enumerates produced a drama, and
Warton was right in giving the precedency to Beccari.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_761" id="Footnote_19_761"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_761"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> In the manuscript Pope had added, "Some of them contain
two hundred lines, and others considerably exceed that number."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_762" id="Footnote_20_762"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_762"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Johnson remarks that while the notion that rustic
characters ought to use rustic phraseology, led to the adoption in
pastorals "of a mangled dialect which no human being ever could have
spoken," the authors had the inconsistency to invest their personages
with a refinement of thought which was incompatible with coarse and
vulgar diction. "Spenser," he continues, "begins one of his pastorals
with studied barbarity:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Diggon Davie, I bid her good day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Diggon her is, or I missay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dig.</i> Her wus her while it was day-light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now her is a most wretched wight.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
What will the reader imagine to be the subject on which speakers like
these exercise their eloquence? Will he not be somewhat disappointed
when he finds them met together to condemn the corruptions of the church
of Rome? Surely at the same time that a shepherd learns theology, he may
gain some acquaintance with his native language."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_763" id="Footnote_21_763"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_763"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> "It was from hence," the poet went on to say in his
manuscript, "I took my first design of the following eclogues. For,
looking upon Spenser as the father of English pastoral, I thought myself
unworthy to be esteemed even the meanest of his sons, unless I bore some
resemblance of him. But, as it happens with degenerate offspring, not
only to recede from the virtues, but to dwindle from the bulk of their
ancestor; so I have copied Spenser in miniature, and reduced his twelve
months into four seasons." When Pope published his Pastorals he stated
that three of them were imitated from Virgil and Theocritus, which
occasioned his cancelling this passage where he speaks as if he had
taken Spenser alone for his model.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_764" id="Footnote_1_764"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_764"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Our author's friendship with this gentleman commenced at
very unequal years; he was under sixteen, but Sir William above sixty,
and had lately resigned his employment of secretary of state to King
William.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p><p>
This amiable old man, who had been a fellow of All Souls College,
Oxford, and doctor of civil law, was sent by Charles II. judge advocate
to Tangier, and afterwards in a public character to Florence, to Turin,
to Paris; and by James II. ambassador to Constantinople; to which city
he went through the continent on foot. He was afterwards a lord of the
treasury, and secretary of state, with the Duke of Shrewsbury, which
office he resigned 1697, and retiring to East Hampstead, died there in
December, 1716, aged seventy-seven. Nothing of his writing remains but
an elegant character of Archbishop Dolben.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
Pope says that Sir William Trumbull had "lately" resigned his office at
the period of their acquaintance, but seven years had elapsed after the
date of Sir William's retirement, before Pope had reached the age of
sixteen.</p></div>

This is the general exordium and opening of the Pastorals, in imitation
of the sixth of Virgil, which some have therefore not improbably thought
to have been the first originally. In the beginnings of the other three
Pastorals, he imitates expressly those which now stand first of the
three chief poets in this kind, Spenser, Virgil, Theocritus.

<p>
Upon this he says to Walsh, "Objection that the letter is hunted too
much&mdash;<i>sing the sylvan</i>&mdash;<i>peaceful plains</i>&mdash;and that the word <i>sing</i> is
used two lines afterwards, <i>Sicilian muses sing</i>." He proposed to read
"try" in the place of "sing;" "happy" instead of "peaceful," and adds,
"Qu&aelig;re. If <i>try</i> be not properer in relation to <i>first</i>, as we first
attempt a thing; and more modest? and if <i>happy</i> be not more than
<i>peaceful</i>?" Walsh replies, "<i>Try</i> is better than <i>sing</i>. <i>Happy</i> does
not sound right, the first syllable being short. Perhaps you may find a
better word than <i>peaceful</i> as <i>flow'ry</i>." Pope rejected all three
epithets, and substituted "blissful."</p></div>

wisdom is the knowledge of ourselves, which terminates in a conviction
of our absolute insignificancy with respect to God, and our relative
inferiority in many instances to the accomplishments of our own species:
and power is encompassed with such a multiplicity of dangerous
temptations as to be almost incompatible with virtue. A passage in
Lucan, viii. 493, is very apposite:

retreated after he had resigned the post of secretary of state of King
William III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p><p>
The address to Trumbull was not in the original manuscript which passed
through his hands, and the lines were probably added when the Pastorals
were prepared for the press. "Little Pope," wrote Sir William to the
Rev. Ralph Bridges on May 2, 1709, "was here two days ago, always full
of poetry and services to Mr. Bridges. I saw in the advertisement, after
he was gone, the Miscellany is published, or publishing, by Jacob
Tonson, wherein are his Pastorals, and which is worse, I am told one of
them is inscribed to my worship." A more inappropriate panegyric could
not have been devised than to pretend that Trumbull was among poets what
the nightingale was among birds. The retired statesman had a true taste
for literature, but his efforts as a versifier had been limited to a
dozen lines translated from Martial.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_774" id="Footnote_11_774"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_774"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Warton observes that the nightingale does not sing till
the other birds are at rest. This is a mistake; the nightingale sings by
day as well as at night, but the expressions "to rest removes" and
"forsaken groves" give an idea of evening, in which case there would be
certainly an error in making the thrush "chant" after the nightingale.
As to the thrush being "charmed to silence" at any time by the
nightingale, and the "a&euml;rial audience" applauding, it is allowable as a
fanciful allusion, perhaps, though the circumstance is contrary to
nature and fact.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_775" id="Footnote_12_775"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_775"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Concanen, in a pamphlet called A Supplement to the
Profound, objected to the use of an image borrowed from the theatre, and
Pope, in vindication of his line, has written "Dryden" in the margin,
alluding doubtless to a couplet in Dryden's verses to the Duchess of
York:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each poet of the air her glory sings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round him the pleased audience clap their wings.<br /></span>

authority cannot recommend it.</p></div>

Concanen having commented in the Supplement to the Profound upon the
impropriety "of making an English clown call a well-known bird by a

<p>
Virgil's commentators cannot agree upon the name which the shepherd had
forgotten, but they unite in commending the stroke of nature which
represents a rustic poet as unable to recall the name of a man of
science.</p></div>

The usage was for the second speaker to imitate the idea started by the
first, and endeavour to outdo him in his vaunt. All the speeches
throughout the contest consisted of the same number of lines. In the
third eclogue of Virgil we have two rivals and an umpire. One of the
antagonists stakes a carved bowl, the other a cow; and the final effort
of each poet is to propound a riddle, upon which the umpire interposes,
and declares that the candidates are equal in merit. Pope keeps close to
his original.</p></div>

"Objection," he says, in the paper he submitted to Walsh, "that <i>hides</i>

Walsh. "<i>Wanton</i> applied to a woman is equivocal, and therefore not

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_813" id="Footnote_50_813"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_813"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Pope had at first written,

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If Sylvia smiles she brightens all the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun's outshined, and nature charms no more.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
This he submitted to Walsh. Pope. "Qu&aelig;re, whether to say the sun is
outshined be too bold and hyperbolical?" Walsh. "For pastoral it is."
Pope. "If it should be softened with <i>seems</i>? Do you approve any of
these alterations?
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If Sylvia smile, she brightens all the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">{ All nature seems outshined, and charms no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">{ Light seems outshined, and nature charms no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">{ And vanquished nature seems to shine no more.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Qu&aelig;re, which of these three?" Walsh. "The last of these three I like
best."</p></div>

<span class="i0">Hot as ripe noon, sweet as the blooming day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like July furious, but more fair than May.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_815" id="Footnote_52_815"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_815"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> An allusion to the royal oak, in which Charles II. had
been hid from the pursuit after the battle of Worcester.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p><p>
This wretched pun on the word "bears" is called "dextrous" by Wakefield,
but Warton says that it is "one of the most trifling and puerile
conceits" in all Pope's works, and is only exceeded in badness by the
riddle "which follows of the thistle and the lily."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_816" id="Footnote_53_816"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_816"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The contraction "I'll," which often occurs in these
pastorals, is familiar and undignified.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_817" id="Footnote_54_817"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_817"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> It was thus in the manuscript:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, tell me first what region canst thou find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which by thistles lilies are outshined?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all thy skill can make the meaning known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prize, the victor's prize, shall be thy own.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Pope submitted the first two lines to Walsh in conjunction with the
version in the text. "Qu&aelig;re, which of these couplets is better
expressed, and better numbers? and whether it is better here to use
<i>thistle</i> or <i>thistles</i>, <i>lily</i> or <i>lilies</i>, singular or plural? The
epithet <i>more happy</i> refers to something going before." Walsh. "The
second couplet [the text] is best; and singular, I think better than
plural."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_818" id="Footnote_55_818"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_818"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Alludes to the device of the Scots' monarchs, the thistle,
worn by Queen Anne; and to the arms of France, the <i>fleur de lys</i>. The
two riddles are in imitation of those in Virg. Ecl. iii. 106:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dic quibus in terris inscripti nomina regum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nascantur flores, et Phyllida solus habeto.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Thus translated by Dryden;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, tell me first in what new region springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flow'r that bears inscribed the names of kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt gain a present as divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Ph&oelig;bus' self, for Phyllis shall be thine.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Either the commentators on Virgil have not hit upon the true solution of
his riddles, or they are not at all superior to the parody of Pope.</p></div>

He was a man of the sweetest disposition, amiable manners, and universal
benevolence. All parties, at a time when party violence was at a great
height, joined in praising and loving him. One of the most exquisite
pieces of wit ever written by Addison, is a defence of Garth against the
Examiner, 1710. It is unfortunate that this second Pastoral, the worst
of the four, should be inscribed to the best judge of all Pope's four
friends to whom they were addressed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

Pope's second Pastoral is an ostensible imitation of Spenser's first
eclogue, which is devoted to a lover's complaint, but though Pope has
echoed some of the sentiments of Spenser, and appropriated an occasional
line, his style has little resemblance to that of his model.</p></div>

Ivy, with the Romans, was the emblem of literary success, and the laurel
crown was worn by a victorious general at a triumph. As Pollio, to whom
Virgil addressed his eighth eclogue, was both a conqueror and a poet,
the double garland allotted to him was appropriate, but there was no

<p>
"Gassendi has well remarked," says Arnauld in his Logic, "that nothing
could be less probable than the notion that the dog-star is the cause of
the extraordinary heat which prevails in what are called the dog days,
because as Sirius is on the other side of the equator, the effects of
the star should be greatest at the places where it is most
perpendicular, whereas the dog days here are the winter season there.
Whence the inhabitants of those countries have much more reason to
believe that the dog-star brings cold than we have to believe that it
causes heat."</p></div>

"Objection," he says to Walsh, "that the first line is too much
transposed from the natural order of the words, and that the rhyme is
inharmonious." He subjoined the couplet in the text, and asked, "Which
of these is best?" to which Walsh replies, "The second."</p></div>

Surely Dr. Johnson's decrying the affected introduction of "crook and

Warton prefers the image of Theocritus, as more wild, more delicate, and
more uncommon. It is natural for a lover to wish that he might be
anything that could come near to his lady. But we more naturally desire
to be that which she fondles and caresses, than to be that which she
avoids, at least would neglect. The superior delicacy of Theocritus I
cannot discover, nor can indeed find, that either in the one or the
other image there is any want of delicacy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span>

Pan was the god of shepherds, the inventor of the pastoral pipe of
reeds, and himself a skilful musician. "The ancient images," says
Archbishop Whately, "represent him as partly in the human form, and
partly in that of a goat, with horns and cloven hoofs. And hence it is
that, by a kind of tradition, we often see, even at this day,
representations of Satan in this form. For the early christians seem to
have thought that it was he whom the pagans adored under the name of
Pan."</p></div>

</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Along the streams, his flock Adonis led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the queen of beauty blest his bed.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
This last verse has nothing answering to it in Virgil, but it suggested
ver. 63 of the pastoral to Pope, who copied Dryden, and not the
original.</p></div>

</p>

Another couplet followed in the manuscript:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here Tereus mourns, and Itys tells his pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Progne they, and I of you complain.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The horrible mythological story of Progne killing her son Itys, and
serving up his flesh to her husband Tereus out of revenge for his
violence to her sister Philomela, had no connection with the plaintive
sighs of a love-sick swain for an absent mistress. The inappropriateness
of the allusion was no doubt the reason why Pope omitted the couplet.</p></div>

original manuscript:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, deign to grace our happy rural seats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our mossy fountains, and our green retreats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While you your presence to the groves deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our flowers are faded, and our brooks are dry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though with'ring herbs lay dying on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At your return they shall be green again.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The two last couplets were copied from Dryden's Virg. Ecl. vii. 77:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if Alexis from our mountains fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n running rivers leave their channels dry.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
And ver. 81:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, if returning Phyllis bless the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grass revives, the woods are green again.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
In Pope's next version, the four lines "While you, &amp;c.," ran as follows:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Winds, where you walk, shall gently fan the glade,<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Or,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where'er you walk fresh gales shall fan the glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trees, where you sit, shall crowd into a shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flow'rs where you tread in painted pride shall rise,<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Or,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where'er you tread the purple flow'rs shall rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all things flourish where you turn your eyes!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Walsh preferred the second form of the passage to the original draught;
and of the variations in the second form he preferred the lines
beginning "Where'er you walk," and "Where'er you tread."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_867" id="Footnote_46_867"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_867"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> He had in view Virg. Ecl. x. 43:

<span class="i0">Your praise the tuneful birds to heav'n shall bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And list'ning wolves grow milder as they hear.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
So the verses were originally written. But the author, young as he was,
soon found the absurdity which Spenser himself overlooked, of
introducing wolves into England.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p><p>
There was no absurdity upon the principle of Pope, that the scene of
pastorals was to be laid in the golden age, which could not be supposed
to be subsequent to the reign of Edward I. when wolves still existed in
this island. They lingered in Scotland in the reign of Charles II., and
in Ireland in the reign of Queen Anne.</p></div>

"The line <i>And headlong streams</i>," says Ruffhead, "surely presents a new
image and a bold one too." Bold indeed! Pope has carried the idea into
extravagance when he makes the stream not only "listening," but "hang
listening in its headlong fall." An idea of this sort will only bear
just touching; the mind then does not perceive its violence; if it be
brought before the eyes too minutely, it becomes almost
ridiculous.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_878" id="Footnote_1_878"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_878"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This Pastoral consists of two parts, like the eighth of
Virgil: the scene, a hill; the time, at sunset.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_879" id="Footnote_2_879"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_879"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Mr. Wycherley, a famous author of comedies; of which the
most celebrated were the Plain-Dealer and Country-Wife. He was a writer
of infinite spirit, satire, and wit. The only objection made to him was,
that he had too much. However, he was followed in the same way by Mr.
Congreve, though with a little more correctness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_880" id="Footnote_3_880"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_880"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Formed on Dryden's version of Ecl. i. 1:

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_881" id="Footnote_4_881"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_881"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Before the edition of 1736 the couplet ran thus:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To whose complaints the list'ning forests bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While one his mistress mourns, and one his friend.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
In keeping with this announcement the song of Hylas, which forms the
first portion of the Pastoral, was devoted to mourning an absent
<i>shepherd</i>, and not, as at present, an absent <i>shepherdess</i>. When Pope
made his lines commemorative of love, instead of friendship, he did
little more than change the name of the man (Thyrsis) to that of a woman
(Delia), and substitute the feminine for the masculine pronoun. The
extravagant idea expressed in the first line of the rejected couplet is
found in Oldham's translation of Moschus:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And trees leaned their attentive branches down.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
There is nothing of the kind in the Greek text.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_882" id="Footnote_5_882"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_882"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> From Dryden's version of Ecl. i. 5:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While stretched at ease you sing your happy loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Amaryllis fills the shady groves.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_884" id="Footnote_7_884"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_884"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> He was always very careful in his encomiums not to fall
into ridicule, the trap which weak and prostitute flatterers rarely
escape. For "sense," he would willingly have said "moral;" propriety
required it. But this dramatic poet's moral was remarkably faulty. His
plays are all shamefully profligate, both in the dialogue and
action.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton.</span>
</p><p>
Warburton's note has more the appearance of an insidious attack upon
Pope than of serious commendation; for if, as Warburton assumes, the
panegyric in the text has reference to the plays and not to the man, it
was a misplaced "encomium" to say that Wycherley "instructed" the world
by the "sense," and "swayed" them by the "judgment," which were
manifested "in a shamefully profligate dialogue and action."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_885" id="Footnote_8_885"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_885"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The reading was "rapture" in all editions till that of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_887" id="Footnote_10_887"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_887"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Till the edition of 1736 the following lines stood in
place of the couplet in the text:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Attend the muse, though low her numbers be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sings of friendship, and she sings to thee.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_888" id="Footnote_11_888"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_888"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Pope had Waller's Thyrsis and Galatea in his memory:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Made the wide country echo to your moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The list'ning trees, and savage mountains groan.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wakefield.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The groans of the trees and mountains are, in Waller's poem, the echo of
the mourner's lamentations, but to this Pope has added that the "moan"
made "the rocks weep," which has no resemblance to anything in nature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_889" id="Footnote_12_889"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_889"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The lines from verse 17 to 30 are very beautiful, tender,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_890" id="Footnote_13_890"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_890"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> It was a time-honoured fancy that the "moan" of the
turtle-dove was a lament for the loss of its mate. <i>Turtur</i>, the Latin
name for the bird, is a correct representation of its monotonous note.
The poets commonly call it simply the turtle, but since the term, to
quote the explanation of Johnson in his Dictionary, is also "used by
sailors and gluttons for a tortoise" the description of its "deep
murmurs" as "filling the sounding shores," calls up this secondary
sense, and gives an air of ludicrousness to the passage.</p></div>

Sentiments like these, as they have no ground in nature, are of little
value in any poem, but in pastoral they are particularly liable to
censure, because it wants that exaltation above common life, which in

figures.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p></div>

This passage in Pope is a strong instance of the abnegation of feeling
in his Pastorals. The shepherd proclaims at the beginning of his chant
that it is his dying speech, and at the end that he has resolved upon
immediate suicide. Having announced the tragedy, Pope treats it with
total indifference, and quietly adds, "Thus sung the shepherds," &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_916" id="Footnote_1_916"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_916"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This was the poet's favourite Pastoral.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton.</span>
</p><p>
It is professedly an imitation of Theocritus, whom Pope does not
resemble, and whose Idylls he could only have read in a translation. The
sources from which he really borrowed his materials will be seen in the
notes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_917" id="Footnote_2_917"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_917"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This lady was of ancient family in Yorkshire, and
particularly admired by the author's friend Mr. Walsh, who having
celebrated her in a Pastoral Elegy, desired his friend to do the same,
as appears from one of his letters, dated Sept. 9, 1706. "Your last
Eclogue being on the same subject with mine on Mrs. Tempest's death, I
should take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn, as if it
were to the memory of the same lady." Her death having happened on the
night of the great storm in 1703, gave a propriety to this Eclogue,
which in its general turn alludes to it. The scene of the Pastoral lies
in a grove, the time at midnight.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p><p>
I do not find any lines that allude to the great storm of which the poet
speaks.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
Nor I. On the contrary, all the allusions to the winds are of the
gentler kind,&mdash;"balmy Zephyrs," "whispering breezes" and so forth. Miss
Tempest was the daughter of Henry Tempest, of Newton Grange, York, and
grand-daughter of Sir John Tempest, Bart. She died unmarried. When
Pope's Pastoral first appeared in Tonson's Miscellany, it was entitled
"To the memory of a Fair Young Lady."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Croker.</span></p></div>

Ovid copied Bion. Idyl. 1. The Greek poet represents the Loves as
trampling upon their bows and arrows, and breaking their quivers in the
first paroxysm of their grief for Adonis. In place of this natural burst
of uncontrollable sorrow, the shepherd, in Pope, invokes the Loves to
break their bows at his instigation. When their darts are said in the
next line to be henceforth useless, the sense must be that nobody would
love any woman again since Mrs. Tempest was dead. Such hyperboles can
neither touch the heart nor gratify the understanding. The Pastorals
were verse exercises in which every pretence to real emotion was laid
aside, for Pope was not even acquainted with the lady of whom he utters
these extravagances.</p></div>

<p>
This idea of the nightingale repeating the lays is amplified by Philips
in his Fifth Pastoral, who copied it, according to Pope in the Guardian,
from Strada. Thence also it must have been borrowed by Pope, and he may
have restored the primitive version to get rid of the coincidence.</p></div>

All this is very poor, and unworthy Pope. First the breeze whispers the
death of Daphne to the trees; then the trees inform the flood of it;
then the flood o'erflows with tears; and then they all deplore together.

</p><p>
Moschus in his third Idyll calls upon the nightingales to tell the river
Arethusa that Bion is dead. Oldham in his imitation of Moschus
exaggerated his original and commanded the nightingales to tell the news
"to <i>all</i> the British floods,"&mdash;to see that it was "conveyed to Isis,
Cam, Thames, Humber, and utmost Tweed," and these in turn were to be
ordered "to waft the bitter tidings on." Pope went further than Oldham,
and describes one class of inanimate objects as conveying the
intelligence to another class of inanimate objects till the whole
uttered lamentations in chorus. Each succeeding copyist endeavoured to
eclipse his predecessor by going beyond him in absurdity. Most of the
ideas adopted by Pope in his Winter had been employed by scores of
elegiac bards. "The numerous pastorals upon the death of princes or
friends," says Dr. Trapp, "are cast in the same mould; read one, you
read all. Birds, sheep, woods, mountains, rivers, are full of
complaints. Everything in short is wondrous miserable."</p></div>

</p><p>
It was one of the stereotyped common-places of elegiac poems, and was
ridiculed in No. 30 of the Guardian. The writer might almost be thought
to have had this passage of Pope in his mind, if his satire did not
equally apply to a hundred authors besides. A shepherd announces to his
fellow-swain that Damon is dead. "This," says the Guardian, "immediately
causes the other to make complaints, and call upon the lofty pines and
silver streams to join in the lamentation. While he goes on, his friend
interrupts him, and tells him that Damon lives, and shows him a track of
light in the skies to conform to it. Upon this scheme most of the noble
families in Great Britain have been comforted; nor can I meet with any
right honourable shepherd that doth not die and live again, after the
manner of the aforesaid Damon."</p></div>

They should have been added by the poet in his own person, instead of
being put into the mouth of a shepherd who is not presumed to have any
knowledge of the previous pieces. The specific character which Pope
ascribes to each of his Pastorals is not borne out by the poems
themselves. There is as much about "flocks" in the first Pastoral as in
the second; and there is as much about "rural lays and loves" in the
second Pastoral as in the first. The third Pastoral contains no mention
of a "sylvan crew," but a couple of shepherds are absorbed by the same
"rural lays and loves" which occupied their predecessors.</p></div>

<h2>MESSIAH,</h2>

<h3>A SACRED ECLOGUE:</h3>

<h3>IN IMITATION OF VIRGIL'S POLLIO.</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>
<h3>ADVERTISEMENT.</h3>

<p>In reading several passages of the Prophet Isaiah, which foretell the
coming of Christ and the felicities attending it, I could not but
observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts, and those in
the Pollio of Virgil. This will not seem surprising, when we reflect,
that the Eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same
subject. One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line, but
selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry,
and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his
piece. I have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him, though
without admitting anything of my own; since it was written with this
particular view, that the reader, by comparing the several thoughts,
might see how far the images and descriptions of the prophet are
superior to those of the poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced them by
my management, I shall subjoin the passages of Isaiah, and those of
Virgil, under the same disadvantage of a literal translation.<a name="FNanchor_1_963" id="FNanchor_1_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_963" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>This is certainly the most animated and sublime of all our author's
compositions, and it is manifestly owing to the great original which he
copied. Perhaps the dignity, the energy, and the simplicity of the
original, are in a few passages weakened and diminished by florid
epithets, and useless circumlocutions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>All things considered, the Messiah is as fine and masterly a piece of
composition as the English language, in the same style of verse, can
boast. I have ventured to point out a passage or two, for they are rare,
where the sublimity has been weakened by epithets; and I have done this,
because it is a fault, particularly with young writers, so common. In
the most truly sublime images of Scripture, the addition of a single
word would often destroy their effect. It is therefore right to keep as
nearly as possible to the very words. No one understood better than
Milton where to be general, and where particular; where to adopt the
very expression of Scripture, and where it was allowed to
paraphrase.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>The fourth eclogue of Virgil is devoted to celebrating the coming birth,
while Pollio is Consul, of a boy whose infancy will usher in the golden
age, and whose manhood will witness its fullness. Wars are to cease; the
beasts of prey are to change their natures; the untilled earth is to
bring forth fruits spontaneously; and peace, ease, and plenty are to
reign supreme. The names of the parents of this expected child are not
recorded, and the commentators are greatly divided upon the question.
The most reasonable conjecture is that the intention was to do homage to
the ruling genius at Rome, Augustus, or C&aelig;sar Octavianus, as he was then
called, whose wife Scribonia was pregnant at the time. Unhappily for the
prognostications of the poet the infant "proved a daughter, and the
infamous Julia."<a name="FNanchor_2_964" id="FNanchor_2_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_964" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Virgil grounds his glowing anticipations upon
certain Cum&aelig;an or Sibylline verses; for, as Jortin well remarks, he
would have deprived his announcement of all authority if he himself had
set up for a prophet. He could only hope to accredit his promised
marvels by appealing to an oracle that was popularly believed to be
inspired. "The Sibylline books," says Prideaux, "were a main engine of
state. When they were ordered to be consulted the keepers of them always
brought forth such an answer as served their purpose, and in many
difficulties the governors helped themselves this way."<a name="FNanchor_3_965" id="FNanchor_3_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_965" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> Virgil was
equally diplomatic. He probably had no faith in the wonders he
announced. His object was to pay court to Augustus, and to assist in
establishing his patron's power.</p>

<p>The resemblance which portions of the Pollio bear to passages in Isaiah
is generally admitted. "This," says Pope, "will not seem surprising when
we reflect that the Eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the
same subject." He does not attempt to explain how the Sibyl came by her
knowledge, unless he means us to infer that she was divinely
illuminated. This theory has been supported by learned men, and would be
warranted if the eight books of Sibylline oracles, still extant in Greek
verse, were anterior to the Christian era; for since they often go
beyond the Old Testament predictions in historic precision, the insight
into futurity could not have been gathered exclusively from the
Scripture prophets. But the existing oracles, says Jortin, "are without
any one exception, mere impostures. They abound with phrases, words,
facts, and passages taken from the Septuagint and the New Testament, and
are a remarkable specimen of astonishing impudence, and miserable
poetry."<a name="FNanchor_4_966" id="FNanchor_4_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_966" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Still there remains the circumstance of the parallelism
between parts of Isaiah and the Eclogue which Virgil based upon the
Sibylline verses. It is easy to account for the coincidence. The
original Sibylline books were accidentally burnt <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 83. A few years
later the senate employed agents to glean together from Italy, Greece,
Sicily and Africa a body of prophecies to replace the oracles which had
perished. The collection was from private as well as public sources, and
a vast number of the same or similar predictions were in the hands of
individuals at Rome. The Jews were located everywhere; they abounded in
Rome itself; they were animated by the expectation that the reign of the
Messiah was approaching; their prophetic records were incomparable for
poetic beauty, sublimity, and variety; the language of the Septuagint
was well understood by lettered pagans, and was even the language of the
new Sibylline oracles, which were embodied in Greek verse. When all
these things are considered, it would be strange if the persons employed
to pick up prophecies had not come across notions, which had either been
derived from personal intercourse with Jews, or from their sacred books.
Although the entire world had been sunk in stupid apathy, and not a
single heathen had been attracted by curiosity to turn his attention to
Hebrew literature and beliefs, it was yet inevitable that a crude
conception should get abroad of the leading idea which fermented in the
mind of the ubiquitous Jew, and nothing was more likely than that it
should be put into Sibylline verse when Roman agents were searching far
and wide for oracles, and inviting contributions from every quarter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>Pope's Messiah first appeared in the Spectator for May 14, 1712, No.
378, where it is prefaced by these words: "I will make no apology for
entertaining the reader with the following poem, which is written by a
great genius, a friend of mine, in the country, who is not ashamed to
employ his wit in the praise of his Maker." After it was published,
Steele wrote on June 1, 1712, to Pope, and said, "I have turned to every
verse and chapter, and think you have preserved the sublime heavenly
spirit throughout the whole, especially at 'Hark a glad voice,' and 'The
lamb with wolves shall graze.' Your poem is better than the Pollio."
Upon this Johnson remarks, "That the Messiah excels the Pollio is no
great praise, if it be considered from what original the improvements
are derived." Bowles and Warton thought that Pope had kept up his verse
to the level of Isaiah, and had only here and there weakened the
sublimity by epithets. Wordsworth was of another opinion. When he
contended that the language of poetry should be a selection from the
real language of men "in a state of vivid sensation," and repudiated the
ornate conventional phraseology which passed for poetic diction, he
pointed to the paraphrases on parts of the Bible in illustration of what
he condemned, and to the passages as they exist in our authorised
version for a specimen of what he approved. "Pope's Messiah throughout"
was in his apprehension an adulteration of the original.<a name="FNanchor_5_967" id="FNanchor_5_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_967" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> His
criticism appears well founded. The pure and natural language of the
prophet is sometimes exchanged for sickly, affected expressions.
"Righteousness" becomes "dewy nectar," "sheep" the "fleecy care," and
the call upon Jerusalem to "Arise and shine" is turned into an
invocation to "exalt her tow'ry head." Apart from these mawkish phrases,
the imitation is framed from first to last upon the mistaken principle
that the original would be embellished by amplifications, by a profusion
of epithets, and by a gaudier diction. The "fir-tree and box-tree" of
Isaiah are called by Pope "the <i>spiry</i> fir, and <i>shapely</i> box." Where
the sacred text announces that "instead of the thorn shall come up the
fir-tree, and instead of the briar shall come up the myrtle-tree," Pope
tells us that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To <i>leafless</i> shrubs the <i>flow'ring</i> palms succeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>od'rous</i> myrtle to the <i>noisome</i> weed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his translation of the prediction, that in the kingdom of Christ,
"the sucking-child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned
child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den," Pope makes the
cockatrice a "<i>crested</i> basilisk," and the asp a "<i>speckled</i> snake;"
they have both scales of a "<i>green</i> lustre," and a "<i>forky</i> tongue," and
with this last the "<i>smiling</i> infant shall <i>innocently</i> play." "The
leopard," says Isaiah, "shall lie down with the kid, and the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
lion, and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them"; but
Pope could not leave this exquisite picture undecorated, and with him
"boys in <i>flow'ry</i> bands the tiger lead." How grievously is the force
and pathos of the passage impaired by the substitution of "boys" for the
"little child"; how completely is the bewitching nature turned into
masquerade by the engrafted notion that the beasts are led by "<i>flow'ry</i>
bands." The alteration is an example of the justice of De Quincey's
observation that "the Arcadia of Pope's age was the spurious Arcadia of
the opera theatre."<a name="FNanchor_6_968" id="FNanchor_6_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_968" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The prophet refers anew to the time when
creatures of prey shall cease to be carnivorous, and relates that "the
lion shall eat straw like the bullock, and dust shall be the serpent's
meat." Pope converts the second clause into the statement that "harmless
serpents lick the pilgrim's feet," which alters the meaning, and
introduces a conception more noticeable for its grotesqueness than for
the enchanting vision it should conjure up of universal peace.<a name="FNanchor_7_969" id="FNanchor_7_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_969" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Pope
says he was induced to subjoin in his notes the passages he had
versified by "the fear that he had prejudiced Isaiah and Virgil by his
management." The reputation of Isaiah and Virgil was safe, and no one
can doubt that his real reason for inviting the comparison was the
belief that he had improved upon them. He imagined that he had enriched
the text of the prophet, and did not suspect that the majesty and truth
of the original were vitiated by his embroidery. Bowles has drawn
attention to the finest parts of the poem, and it may be allowed that
the piece in general is powerful of its kind. The fault is in the kind
itself, which belongs to a lower style than the living strains of
Isaiah, and borders too closely upon the meretricious to suit the lofty
theme. The Messiah is a prophetic vision of a golden age, and on this
account was classed by Pope among his Pastorals.<a name="FNanchor_8_970" id="FNanchor_8_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_970" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</p><p>
The passage from Virgil, in which the shrubs are supposed to cry out "a
god, a god," is not from the same Eclogue with the rest of Pope's
extracts, and has no reference to the anticipated appearance of a ruler
who should regenerate the world. The occasion of the shout is the

poet meant the sight, or, as Milton calls it, indeed, something less
boldly, "the visual nerve." And no critic would quarrel with the figure
which calls the instrument of vision by the name of the cause. But
though the term be just, nay noble, and even sublime, yet the expression
of "thick films" is faulty, and he fell into it by a common neglect of
the following rule of good writing, that when a figurative word is used,
whatsoever is predicated of it ought not only to agree in terms to the
thing to which the figure is applied, but likewise to that from which
the figure is taken. "Thick films" agree only with the thing to which it
is applied, namely, to the sight or eye; and not to that from which it
is taken, namely, a ray of light coming to the eye. He should have said
"thick clouds," which would have agreed with both. But these
inaccuracies are not to be found in his later poems.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warburton.</span>
</p><p>
Concanen had previously made the same objection in his Supplement to the
Profound, and Pope has written in the margin, "Milton," who uses "visual
ray," Par. Lost, iii. 620, "visual nerve" xi. 415, and "visual beam,"
Samson Agonistes, ver. 163; but none of these passages support Pope's
misapplication of the phrase "thick films" to rays of light.</p></div>

Steele having objected that Pope's line "in exalted and poetical spirit"

The meaning of the original has been missed by Pope. The promise was not
that men should cease to die, which would be the ease if Death was
"bound in adamantine chains," but that death should lose its terrors
through "the life and immortality brought to light by the gospel," and

<h2>WINDSOR FOREST.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">To the Right Honourable George, Lord Landsdown.</span></h3>

<span class="i0">London: Printed for <span class="smcap">Bernard Lintott</span>, at the Cross-keys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">in Fleet Street.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The work appeared before March 9, 1713, on which day Swift
writes to Stella, "Mr. Pope has published a fine poem,
called Windsor Forest. Read it." In his manuscript Pope
says, "It was first printed in folio in &mdash;&mdash;. Again in folio
the same year, and in octavo the next." It was included in
the quarto of 1717, in the second edition of Lintot's
Miscellany in 1714, and in the four succeeding editions of
1720, 1722, 1727 and 1732.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>


<p>This poem was written at two different times. The first part of it,
which relates to the country, in the year 1704, at the same time with
the Pastorals. The latter part was not added till the year 1713, in
which it was published.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></p>

<p>In 1713 Pope published Windsor Forest; of which part was, as he relates,
written at sixteen, about the same time as his Pastorals; and the latter
part was added afterwards: where the addition begins we are not told.<a name="FNanchor_1_1036" id="FNanchor_1_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1036" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The lines relating to the Peace confess their own date. It is dedicated
to Lord Lansdowne, who was then in high reputation and influence among
the tories; and it is said, that the conclusion of the poem gave great
pain to Addison, both as a poet and a politician. Reports like this are
often spread with boldness very disproportionate to their evidence. Why
should Addison receive any particular disturbance from the last lines of
Windsor Forest? If contrariety of opinion could poison a politician, he
would not live a day; and, as a poet, he must have felt Pope's force of
genius much more from many other parts of his works. The pain that
Addison might feel, it is not likely that he would confess; and it is
certain that he so well suppressed his discontent, that Pope now thought
himself his favourite.</p>

<p>The design of Windsor Forest is evidently derived from Cooper's Hill,
with some attention to Waller's poem on the Park; but Pope cannot be
denied to excel his masters in variety and elegance, and the art of
interchanging description, narrative, and morality. The objection made
by Dennis is the want of plan, of a regular subordination of parts,
terminating in the principal and original design. There is this want in
most descriptive poems, because as the scenes, which they must exhibit
successively, are all subsisting at the same time, the order in which
they are shown must, by necessity, be arbitrary, and more is not to be
expected from the last part than from the first. The attention,
therefore, which cannot be detained by suspense, must be excited by
diversity, such as this poem offers to its reader. But the desire of
diversity may be too much indulged. The parts of Windsor Forest which
deserve least praise are those which were added to enliven the stillness
of the scene&mdash;the appearance of Father Thames, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> transformation
of Lodona. Addison had, in his Campaign, derided the rivers, that "rise
from their oozy beds" to tell stories of heroes;<a name="FNanchor_2_1037" id="FNanchor_2_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1037" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and it is therefore
strange that Pope should adopt a fiction not only unnatural, but lately
censured. The story of Lodona is told with sweetness; but a new
metamorphosis is a ready and puerile expedient. Nothing is easier than
to tell how a flower was once a blooming virgin, or a rock an obdurate
tyrant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>Descriptive poetry was by no means the shining talent of Pope. This
assertion may be manifested by the few images introduced in the poem
before us which are not equally applicable to any place whatsoever.
Rural beauty in general, and not the peculiar beauties of the forest of
Windsor, are here described. Nor are the sports of setting, shooting,
and fishing, at all more appropriated. The stag-chase, that immediately
follows, although some of the lines are incomparably good, is not so
full, so animated, and so circumstantial, as that of
Somerville.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p>

<p>Johnson remarks that this poem was written after the model of Denham's
Cooper's Hill, with, perhaps, an eye on Waller's poem of the Park.
Marvel has also written a poem on local scenery<a name="FNanchor_3_1038" id="FNanchor_3_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1038" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;upon the hill and
grove at Billborow, and another on Appleton House (now Nunappleton), in
Yorkshire. Marvel abounds with conceits and false thoughts, but some of
the descriptive touches are picturesque and beautiful. He sometimes
observes little circumstances of rural nature with the eye and feeling
of a true poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then as I careless on the bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gelid strawberries do tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the hazels thick espy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>hatching thrustle's shining eye</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last circumstance is new, highly poetical, and could only have been
described by one who was a real lover of nature, and a witness of her
beauties in her most solitary retirements. Before this descriptive poem
on Windsor Forest, I do not recollect any other professed composition on
local scenery, except the poems of the authors already mentioned.
Denham's is certainly the best prior to Pope's: his description of
London at a distance is sublime:<a name="FNanchor_4_1039" id="FNanchor_4_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1039" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Under his proud survey the city lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a mist beneath a hill does rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose state and wealth, the bus'ness and the crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems at this distance but a <i>darker cloud</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pope, by the expression of "majestic," has justly characterised the flow
of Denham's couplets. It is extraordinary that Pope, who, by this
expression, seems to have appreciated the general cast of harmony in
Cooper's Hill, should have made his own cadences so regular and almost
unvaried. Denham's couplets are often irregular, but the effect of the
pauses in the following lines was obviously the result of a fine ear.
The language truly suits the subject:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But his proud head the airy mountain hides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the clouds; his shoulders and his sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shady mantle clothes; his curled brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frown on the gentle stream, which calmly flows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst winds and storms his lofty forehead beat!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The occasional introduction of such passages should be managed with
great care, but I appeal to any judge of poetry whether he does not feel
the effect intended to be raised by the pauses of the lines just quoted?</p>

<p>He who has not an eye to observe every external appearance that nature
may exhibit in every change of season, and who cannot with a glance
distinguish every diversity of every hue in her variety of beauties,
must so far be deficient in one of the essential qualities of a poet.
Here Pope, from infirmities and from physical causes, was particularly
deficient. When he left his own laurel circus at Twickenham, he was
lifted into his chariot or his barge; and with weak eyes and tottering
strength, it is physically impossible he could be a descriptive bard.
Where description has been introduced among his poems, as far as his
observation could go, he excelled; more could not be expected. It is for
this reason that his Windsor Forest, and his Pastorals, must ever appear
so defective to a lover of nature. In his Windsor Forest he has
description, incident, and history. The descriptive part is too general,
and unappropriate; the incident, or story part, is such as only would
have been adopted by a young man who had just read Ovid; but the
historical part is very judiciously and skilfully blended, and the
conclusion highly animated and poetical: nor can we be insensible to its
more lofty tone of versification.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p>

<p>Richardson transcribed the various readings of Windsor Forest into his
copy of the quarto of 1717, and added this note:&mdash;"Altered from the
first copy of the author's own hand, written out beautifully,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> as usual,
for the perusal and criticism of his friends." The manuscript in
Richardson's possession did not contain the entire work, but stopped at
ver. 390. On the title-page of the manuscript was a memorandum by Pope,
which says, "This poem was written just after the Pastorals, as appears
by the last verse of it. That was in the year &mdash;&mdash;, when the author was
---- years of age. But the last hundred lines, including the celebration
of the Peace, were added in the year &mdash;&mdash;, soon after the ratification
of the treaty of Utrecht." Pope supplied the omitted dates in the octavo
of 1736, where he ascribes the former part of Windsor Forest to 1704,
and the latter part to 1710. The testimony of Pope carries little
weight, and there is no subsidiary evidence to confirm the improbable
statement that the larger portion of the poem was produced as early as
1704. The date he assigned to the remainder, in a note at ver. 1 of the
edition of 1736, and again in a note on ver. 289, must have been a slip
of the pen, or an error of the press. Warburton altered 1710 to 1713 in
the first note, and left the mistake uncorrected in the second. The
amended date was a fresh blunder, for it appears from the letters of
Pope to Caryll on Nov. 29, and Dec. 5, 1712, that the new conclusion was
then complete. Pope's memory deceived him when he stated that the end of
the poem was written "soon after the ratification of the treaty of
Utrecht." The treaty, as Mr. Croker remarks, was not signed till March
30, 1713, nor ratified till April 28, and Windsor Forest was published
before March 9. The Peace had for some months been an accepted fact, and
Pope did not wait for its formal ratification.</p>

<p>"Lord Lansdowne," said Pope to Spence, "insisted on my publishing my
Windsor Forest, and the motto (<i>non injussa cano</i>) shows it."<a name="FNanchor_5_1040" id="FNanchor_5_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1040" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Pope
not only published, but composed Windsor Forest at the instigation of
Lord Lansdowne, if the opening lines of the poem are to be believed.
Trumbull, however, asserts that it was he who suggested the topic to
Pope. "I should have commended his poem on Windsor Forest much more,"
wrote Sir William to Mr. Bridges, May 12, 1713, "if he had not served me
a slippery trick; for you must know I had long since put him upon this
subject, gave several hints, and at last, when he brought it, and read
it, and made some little alterations, &amp;c., not one word of putting in my
name till I found it in print." The apparent discrepancy may be
explained by the supposition that Trumbull proposed the earlier poem on
the Forest, and Lord Lansdowne the subsequent celebration of the Peace.
The poet tacked the new matter on to the old, and may have represented
that he sang at the command of Granville, because the ultimate form
which the work assumed was due to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Delany, who was the niece of Lord Lansdowne, and lived with him in
her youth, says, in her Autobiography, that he was a man of an open
unsuspecting temper, that he had the greatest politeness and good-humour
imaginable, that he was magnificent in his nature, and wasted his
fortune to gratify his passion for display.<a name="FNanchor_6_1041" id="FNanchor_6_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1041" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> His predominant
characteristics were amiability and vanity. His love of distinction
incited him to become a dramatist, poet, and politician. He had
aspirations without ability, and in none of these capacities did he
exhibit any vigour of mind. His poetry was an imitation of Waller, "of
whom," says Johnson, "he copied the faults, and very little more."<a name="FNanchor_7_1042" id="FNanchor_7_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1042" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
His plays reflect the worst qualities of the era of Charles II. In
tragedy he thought that to be dull and stately was to be classical; in
comedy that affected briskness of dialogue was liveliness, and indecent
double meanings wit. He made no figure in politics, and owed his posts
in the Harley administration to his wealth, family, and electioneering
influence. His literature, aided by his hereditary advantages, sufficed
to procure him a factitious fame while he lived, but his reputation was
at an end the moment his works lost the lustre they derived from his
social position.</p>

<p>Lord Lansdowne was at the zenith of his career when he persuaded Pope to
eulogise the Peace. A measure in itself wise had been made subservient
to the personal interests of the unprincipled faction in power. These
intriguers could not carry on the war without the commanding genius of
Marlborough, nor allow a political opponent to perpetuate his ascendancy
by a fresh series of victories. Certain that they would be driven from
office unless they could huddle up a peace, they were guilty of a
treacherous connivance with the enemy, and a flagrant breach of faith
towards their allies. They were compelled to grant terms to France which
were the boast of her minister, Torcy, and which Bolingbroke confessed
were not what policy or our successes required.<a name="FNanchor_8_1043" id="FNanchor_8_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1043" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A man of more
enlightened views might have justly urged that hard conditions,
offensive to the pride of a great nation, were less calculated to ensure
a lengthened peace than lenient demands, which allowed the consolation
of an honourable retreat. No such plea was put forth by Bolingbroke. He
always retained the vulgar idea that France ought to have been "humbled"
and her "power reduced for generations to come." He lamented the
moderation of the treaty, and threw the blame upon the want of union
among the allies, which was itself occasioned by the knowledge that he
and his colleagues had determined to sacrifice all other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> interests to
their own.<a name="FNanchor_9_1044" id="FNanchor_9_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1044" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> There was a risk that a treaty which was thought
inadequate by its authors would rouse universal indignation, and prove
as fatal to their power as the continuance of the war. The Peace became
the political test of the hour, and every artifice of prose and verse
was employed to appease public opinion.</p>

<p>Pope did not stop with applauding the Peace; he denounced the
Revolution. He afterwards professed a lofty superiority to party
prejudices; but there were obvious reasons which might induce him to lay
aside his usual caution at this crisis. The war was directed against
Louis XIV., the champion of Roman Catholicism, and the Pretender. A
general belief prevailed that the Protestant succession could only be
secured by reducing the French king to helplessness, and that a Peace,
on the other hand, which saved him and the Harley administration from
ruin, would be propitious to the cause of tories, papists, and
Jacobites. "They fancied," says Bolingbroke, "that the Peace was the
period at which their millenary year would begin."<a name="FNanchor_10_1045" id="FNanchor_10_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1045" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> A young and
sanguine poet may well have shared a conviction in which both sides
concurred,&mdash;the ministerialists by their hopes, and the opposition by
their fears. No sooner was the treaty concluded than it became apparent
that the hopes and fears were exaggerated. The ministry was torn to
pieces by intestine divisions; its supporters&mdash;a heterogeneous body, who
had been loosely held together by a common enmity&mdash;were rapidly throwing
off their allegiance; the good will, which had been founded upon large
and vague expectations, was converted into hostility under total
disappointment; and the failing health of the Queen rendered it probable
that the accession of a whig sovereign would shortly complete the
discomfiture of the faction. After the conclusion of the Peace, says
Bolingbroke, "we saw nothing but increase of mortification, and nearer
approaches to ruin."<a name="FNanchor_11_1046" id="FNanchor_11_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1046" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Having been too precipitate in casting in his lot with the tories, Pope
hastened to qualify his rashness by conciliating the whigs, and
undertook to furnish the Prologue to Addison's Cato. This play was
brought out April 14, 1713, at the request of the opposition, who
intended it for a remonstrance against the arbitrary projects imputed to
the ministry. The tragedy was hurried upon the stage towards the close
of the dramatic season, lest the salutary lesson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> should come too late
to save the threatened constitution.<a name="FNanchor_12_1047" id="FNanchor_12_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1047" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Pope told Spence that the
manuscript was submitted to him by Addison, that he thought the action
not sufficiently theatrical, and that he recommended the author to
forego its performance. Shortly afterwards Addison went to him and said,
"that some particular friends, whom he could not disoblige, insisted on
its being acted." He protested that he had no party purpose in the play,
commissioned Pope to convey this assurance to Oxford and Bolingbroke,
sent them the tragedy along with the message, and obtained their
encouragement. When a year and a half had elapsed, and the House of
Hanover had succeeded to the English throne, Addison published in Nov.
1714, a copy of verses to the Princess of Wales, in which he took credit
for the patriotism and daring of his muse in sending forth the play with
the express design of defeating the machinations of the government.<a name="FNanchor_13_1048" id="FNanchor_13_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1048" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And boldly rising for Britannia's laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engaged great Cato in her country's cause.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hurd, unwilling to condemn his hero, Addison, and accepting, without
misgiving, the statement reported by Spence, exclaims, "How spotless
must that man be, that, in passing through a court, had only contracted
this slight stain, even in the opinion of so severe a censor and casuist
as Mr. Pope."<a name="FNanchor_14_1049" id="FNanchor_14_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_1049" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But unless the conduct of Addison is misrepresented he
must have been corrupt and contemptible. The party of which he was a
prominent member urged the production of his play, at a momentous
crisis, with a political object, and it would have been mean and
treacherous to yield to their entreaties, and then privately assure the
common enemy that nothing political was intended. The baseness would
have been great indeed if, when the power passed over to the whigs, he
triumphantly declared that he had pursued the very course he disavowed
at the time, and thus endeavoured by a false boast to procure new credit
and rewards. Either Addison was unscrupulous, or Pope fabricated the
tale. Addison's version was published to the world: Pope's version was
dropped into the ear of Spence. Addison made his claim when the
circumstances were fresh, and when Pope, Bolingbroke, and Oxford were at
hand to expose him: Pope told his story after the lapse of many years,
when he had quarrelled with Addison, and the subject of his aspersions
was in the grave. Addison has never been convicted of an untruthful
word, or a dishonourable act: Pope's career was a labyrinth of deceit,
and he abounded in audacious malignant inventions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> These considerations
are sufficient, but there is more direct evidence. "I have had lately,"
wrote Pope to Caryll, Feb. 1713, "the entertainment of reading Mr.
Addison's tragedy of Cato. It drew tears from me in several parts of the
fourth and fifth acts, where the beauty of virtue appears so charming,
that I believe, if it comes upon the theatre, we shall enjoy that which
Plato thought the greatest pleasure an exalted soul could be capable of,
a view of virtue itself dressed in person, colour, and action. The
emotion which the mind will feel from this character, and the sentiments
of humanity which the distress of such a person as Cato will stir up in
us, must necessarily fill an audience with so glorious a disposition and
sovereign a love of virtue, that I question if any play has ever
conduced so immediately to morals as this." Here is Pope prognosticating
that Cato upon the stage will melt, delight, and animate the audience.
He penned the words at the exact period when, according to his later
assertion, he was admonishing Addison that the play was unsuited to the
theatre, and he is self-convicted by the contradiction. One-half of his
story was false, and renders the other half worthless.<a name="FNanchor_15_1050" id="FNanchor_15_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_1050" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In the account which Pope gave to Caryll of the first night of Cato he
said that "all the foolish industry possible had been used to make it a
party play," and complained that "the prologue writer was clapped into a
stanch whig, sore against his will, at almost every two lines."<a name="FNanchor_16_1051" id="FNanchor_16_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_1051" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He
might be anxious to persuade his jacobite correspondent that he had not
been abetting a whig manifesto, and might pretend that he was annoyed at
the construction put upon the Prologue, but his verses were chiefly
devoted to enforcing the political doctrine of the play, and he must
deliberately have laid himself out to catch the applause of its friends.
His management advanced his fortunes. Windsor Forest procured him the
acquaintance and patronage of the tory leaders. Swift recommended the
poem to Stella on March 9, 1713, and in November he was heard by Dr.
Kennet "instructing a young nobleman that the best poet in England was
Mr. Pope, a papist, who had begun a translation of Homer into English
verse, for which he must have them all subscribe, 'for,' says he, 'the
author shall not begin to print till I have a thousand guineas for
him.'"<a name="FNanchor_17_1052" id="FNanchor_17_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_1052" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The other magnates of the faction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> joined with Swift in
befriending him. In those heated times a Roman Catholic who had won over
one party to his interests, by proclaiming his jacobite bias in verse,
would naturally have fallen under the ban of their opponents; but his
standing sponsor for the whig play, and the relations he maintained with
whig authors, kept the whigs from renouncing him. To his art in
attracting notice to his poetry through his politics, and in combining
the suffrages of embittered political antagonists, he owed the
unexampled success of the Homer subscription, which secured his
pecuniary independence. He had served both masters by turns, though in
unequal degrees, and then unreasonably complained to Caryll that some
people called him a whig, and others called him a tory.<a name="FNanchor_18_1053" id="FNanchor_18_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_1053" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He
disclaimed being either. He talked of his abhorrence of party violence,
and propounded his principles in dark unmeaning generalities from which
nothing can be gathered, except that he wished to avoid being held
responsible for any opinions whatever. He did not take up the position
that a purely literary undertaking was independent of politics. The
moment the tory cause declined he pleaded his neutrality, and seemed to
imagine that he could claim the support of all parties on the ground
that he adhered to none. The less wary patron who bespoke Windsor Forest
had to suffer for his jacobite zeal. He was arrested on Sept. 21, 1715,
and remained in the Tower till Feb. 8, 1717. Bolingbroke and Oxford were
impeached, and the selfish bargain they had brought about by
dishonourable means, that they might prolong their rule, annihilated
their power for ever.</p>

<p>"A person," says Warton, "of no small rank has informed me, that Mr.
Addison was inexpressibly chagrined at the noble conclusion of Windsor
Forest, both as a politician and as a poet,&mdash;as a politician, because it
so highly celebrated that treaty of peace which he deemed so pernicious
to the liberties of Europe; and as a poet, because he was deeply
conscious that his own Campaign, that gazette in rhyme, contained no
strokes of such genuine and sublime poetry."<a name="FNanchor_19_1054" id="FNanchor_19_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_1054" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This is one of those
plausible imputations which enemies propagate on the evidence of their
own suspicions, and which therefore require to be substantiated by
unexceptionable testimony. Warton had nothing better to adduce in
support of the credibility of his informant than the irrelevant
circumstance that he was "a person of no small rank." The description of
the witness declares his incompetence. It is not pretended that the
"person of no small rank" was intimate with Addison, or had any
authentic means of ascertaining his sentiments, and they are certainly
misrepresented by the assertion that he could not endure poetical
panegyrics on a Peace he disapproved, for in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> Spectator of Oct. 30,
1712, he wrote up Tickell's laudatory verses, and "hoped his poem would
meet with such a reward from its patrons as so noble a performance
deserved."<a name="FNanchor_20_1055" id="FNanchor_20_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_1055" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> There is not a party word added to extenuate the praise;
a tory might have endorsed the essay. Intolerance and "inexpressible
chagrin" were not at any time characteristics of Addison.</p>

<p>Tickell's Prospect of Peace went through six editions, and to judge by
the sale was more popular than Windsor Forest, which was published four
months later. The greater success of the far inferior poem was doubtless
owing to the eulogium in the Spectator. Pope joined in applauding
Tickell's work. He said that it contained "several most poetical images,
and fine pieces of painting," he specified certain "strokes of mastery,"
and he especially commended the versification.<a name="FNanchor_21_1056" id="FNanchor_21_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_1056" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> His too liberal
praise may have been influenced by the couplet in which Tickell
exclaimed,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like the young spreading laurel, Pope! thy name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoots up with strength and rises into fame.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nearly the whole of the poem is in an equally dreary style, and this
dull mediocrity was not attained without numerous imitations of ancient
and modern authors. The insipidity did not exclude extravagance; for
both poetry and patriotism were thought to be displayed by a nonsensical
exaggeration of British beauty, valour, and power.</p>

<p>Windsor Forest is not free from flat passages, inflation of sentiment,
and false and puerile thoughts. Pope mixed up in it the beauties of his
manlier period with the vices of his early style. No writer clung more
tenaciously to the lifeless phantoms of paganism, nor applied the
hereditary common-places in a more servile manner. Liberty is
"Britannia's goddess;" the sun is "Ph&oelig;bus' fiery car;" the sea is
"Neptune's self;" the harvest is "Ceres' gifts;" the orchard is "Pomona
crowned with fruits;" the ground is "painted by blushing Flora; "and the
flocks on the hills are attended by Pan. This last personage leaves his
innocent pastoral employment to chase, with evil intentions, "a rural
nymph" who calls on "Father Thames" for aid. Father Thames is deaf or
indifferent, and Pan is about to clutch her when at her own request she
is dissolved into a river. Before her transformation she was one of the
"buskined virgins" of Diana, what time the goddess forsook "Cynthus'
top" for Windsor, and was often seen roving there over the "airy
wastes." There was no occasion now to envy "Arcadia the immortal
huntress and her virgin train," since Windsor could boast</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As bright a goddess, and as chaste a queen,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></div></div>

<p>and the poet proceeds to complete the comparison between Diana and Queen
Anne,&mdash;between the virgin huntress, and a prolific mother, who was ugly,
corpulent, gouty, sluggish, a glutton and a tippler. Pope afterwards
affected a disdain of royalty; he was ready enough to flatter it when he
had his own ends to serve. He could not have devised a less felicitous
compliment. Tickell's poem was specially praised in the Spectator for
its freedom from the follies of "pagan theology." Addison laughed at the
whole tiresome tribe of gods and goddesses, and, with good-humoured
pleasantry, warned the versifiers, who were about to celebrate the
Peace, against introducing "trifling antiquated fables unpardonable in a
poet that was past sixteen." He laid stress upon the circumstance that
in a panegyric, which should be distinguished for truth, "nothing could
be more ridiculous than to have recourse to our Jupiters and Junos,"<a name="FNanchor_22_1057" id="FNanchor_22_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_1057" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and no incongruity of the kind could be more absurd than to couple Diana
and Queen Anne. Windsor Forest was still in manuscript when Addison's
essay appeared. Pope was not at the pains to re-cast his poem, but he
must have recognised the force of the playful satire, and thenceforward
he abjured mythological trash.</p>

<p>The passage on the death of Cowley exemplifies, in a short compass, the
unskilful use to which Pope put the worn-out rags of antiquity:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O early lost! what tears the river shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sad pomp along his banks was led!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His drooping swans on ev'ry note expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his willows hung each muse's lyre.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The appropriate business of poetry," says Wordsworth, "her privilege,
and her duty, is to treat of things not as they are, but as they appear;
not as they exist in themselves, but as they seem to exist to the senses
and passions."<a name="FNanchor_23_1058" id="FNanchor_23_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_1058" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Since genuine emotions are often founded upon
fancies, since thoughts are not always the true reflection of outward
realities, poetasters, and even poets, have concluded that they might
represent things neither as they are nor as they appear, might neglect
nature altogether, and be unfaithful alike to the world of intelligence,
and the world of matter. To this spurious class of invention belong the
notions that a river, which had flowed for ages, was the tears of the
river-god lamenting the newly-deceased Cowley, and that all the swans on
the Thames died with grief on the day of his funeral. The mind refuses
to admit such jejune and monstrous fictions among the illusions of
imagination. The compound of mythological and biblical ideas in the
fourth line has converted a pathetic incident in the Psalms into a cold
and miserable conceit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> The harp of the Jew was a reality; and when he
wept over his captivity by the rivers of Babylon he hung up his harp in
very truth because his broken spirit would not permit him to sing the
Lord's song in a strange land. There is, on the contrary, only hollow
pedantry in the pretence that non-existent muses hung up non-existent
lyres on the willows of the Thames because Cowley was dead. The passage
goes on in the same empty artificial strain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who now shall charm the shades, where Cowley strung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His living harp, and lofty Denham sung?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hark! the groves rejoice, the forest rings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these revived?&mdash;or is it Granville sings?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is an excellent remark of Bowles that there are some ideas which will
only just bear touching. The earliest poems were sung, and singing
became synonymous with poetical composition, but when a phrase, which is
now a mere figure of speech, is expanded, and the groves are said to
rejoice, and the forests to ring with the singing of Granville, the
predominant effect produced by the metaphor is a sense of its falsity
and grotesqueness. The picture called up is not that of a poet, but of a
half-crazed opera singer. This sickly vein of counterfeit pastoral is
continued, and we are told that the groves of Windsor are filled with
the name of Mira, the subject of Lord Lansdowne's amatory verses, and
that the Cupids tuned the lover's lyre in the shades.</p>

<p>The lines on Lord Lansdowne offend the more from the fulsomeness of the
adulation. Pope said that "flattery turned his stomach,"<a name="FNanchor_24_1059" id="FNanchor_24_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_1059" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which meant
that he could not endure his own vices in other people. He had
emphatically satirised the sycophancy which estimated literary works by
the rank of the author:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What woful stuff this madrigal would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some starved hackney sonneteer, or me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let a lord once own the happy lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the wit brightens! how the style refines!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each exalted stanza teems with thought.<a name="FNanchor_25_1060" id="FNanchor_25_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_1060" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The "sacred name" of Lansdowne imparted genius to verse which would have
been "woful stuff" in Dennis or Welsted. When Pope, in later years,
called him "Granville the polite" he characterised him correctly; when,
in Windsor Forest, he exalted him to the rank of a transcendent poet, he
said what he could not believe. He outraged candour in prose as well as
in verse. He wrote a sycophantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> letter to Lord Lansdowne, boasting his
freedom from the insincerity of his "fellow scribblers" who composed
panegyrics "at random, and persuaded the next vain creature they could
find that it was his own likeness." Pope vowed he had erred in the
opposite direction, and had forborne to praise Lord Lansdowne up to the
height of his deserts out of deference to his modesty. "Whereas others
are offended if they have not more than justice done them, you would be
displeased if you had so much. Therefore I may safely do you as much
injury in my word as you do yourself in your own thoughts. I am so vain
as to think I have shown you a favour in sparing your modesty, and you
cannot but make me some return for prejudicing the truth to gratify
you."<a name="FNanchor_26_1061" id="FNanchor_26_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_1061" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Here was triple incense,&mdash;the original adulation, the
protestation that it was inadequate, and the pretence that Lord
Lansdowne, a man noted for vanity, was too modest to endure merited
praise. Pope spoke more truth than he intended when he said that he had
"prejudiced truth to gratify him."</p>

<p>"Who now reads Cowley?" asked Pope in 1737.<a name="FNanchor_27_1062" id="FNanchor_27_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_1062" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The panegyric in Windsor
Forest was an anachronism, and he might have asked the same question in
1713. Never was an equal reputation more ephemeral. While Cowley lived,
and for a few years afterwards, the most cultivated minds in the kingdom
called him the "great Cowley," the "incomparable Cowley," the "divine
Cowley." When he died, Denham said that Death had</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Plucked the fairest, sweetest flow'r<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the Muses' garden grew.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The herd of readers vied with men of letters in applauding him, as was
shown by the sale of his works, and is implied in the couplet of Oldham:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One likes my verses, and commends each line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swears that Cowley's are but dull to mine.<a name="FNanchor_28_1063" id="FNanchor_28_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_1063" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The wonder is not that he lost his pre-eminence, but that he ever
obtained it. His poetry is a puzzle from its contradictory qualities.
Some of his pieces have a gay facility which had not hitherto been
rivalled, and the greater part are harsh, heavy and obscure. He loved to
search for remote analogies, and his profusion of far-fetched similes
are constantly of a kind which debase the subject they are intended to
elevate and adorn. His language is incessantly pitched in a high, heroic
key, and then sinks in the same, or the succeeding sentence, into the
tamest, meanest phrases of colloquial prose. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> verse in entire poems,
as well as in single lilies and occasional passages, is remarkable for
its tripping ease, and is more often rugged to such a degree that it is
incredible how it could pass with him for verse at all. The faulty side
in him predominates, and the general impression he leaves is that of
dullness, laboured and negligent by turns. He did not owe the whole of
his popularity to his real abilities, and the bad taste of his age. He
was a conspicuous adherent of the Stuarts, and the cavaliers adopted his
works out of compliment to his politics. The grand funeral procession,
commemorated in Windsor Forest, was a tribute paid to him by a party,
because he united the fame of a forward royalist to the celebrity of an
author. In a generation when authors and royalists were both dissolute,
his writings had at least the merit of being untainted by the prevailing
vice. Pope, describing the infidelity and debauchery of the Restoration
era, exclaims,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unhappy Dryden! in all Charles's days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roscommon only boasts unspotted bays.<a name="FNanchor_29_1064" id="FNanchor_29_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_1064" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He might have remembered Milton if he overlooked Cowley, who was
nevertheless a far greater poet than Roscommon. The one had gleams of
genius, and the other had none. The contemporaries of Cowley had not
been blind to the moral merits of his productions. "I cannot," says Sir
John Denham, "but mention with honour my friend Mr. Cowley, who was the
first who of late offered to redeem poesy from that slavery wherein this
depraved age has prostituted her to all imaginable uncleanness."<a name="FNanchor_30_1065" id="FNanchor_30_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_1065" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> His
request in his will, that his compositions, printed and manuscript,
should be collected by Dr. Sprat, was accompanied by a clause
"beseeching him not to let any pass (if anything of that kind has
escaped my pen) which may give the least offence in point of religion
and good manners." His life was in keeping with his writings. Evelyn
calls him that "incomparable poet, and virtuous man;" and Pepys heard
Dr. Ward, the bishop of Winchester, and Dr. Bates, the well-known
puritan, "mightily lamenting his death, as the best poet of our nation
and as good a man."<a name="FNanchor_31_1066" id="FNanchor_31_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_1066" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The king was pleased to add his testimony,
worthless if it had stood alone, and declared "that Mr. Cowley had not
left a better man behind him in England."<a name="FNanchor_32_1067" id="FNanchor_32_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_1067" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>"In Windsor Forest," says Bowles, "there is description, incident, and
history." A few remarks may still be made on it under each of these
heads. Wordsworth assigned to it the distinction, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> conjunction with
Lady Winchelsea's Nocturnal Reverie, of containing the only "new images
of external nature" to be found "in the poetry of the period intervening
between Paradise Lost and the Seasons."<a name="FNanchor_33_1068" id="FNanchor_33_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_1068" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He limited the praise to "a
passage or two," and does not particularise the passages to which he
alluded. He must chiefly have referred to the lines from ver. 111 to
ver. 146; for the other happy "images of external nature" are borrowed.
Pope had but a faint perception of latent and subtle beauties, and he
usually kept to those general appearances which are obvious to all the
world. His trees cast a shade, his streams murmur, his heath is purple,
his harvests are yellow, and his skies blue. Living in the midst of
English peasants he shows less familiarity with rural character than
with rural scenes. Neither in his verse, nor his letters, is there
anything to indicate that he had mixed, like Thomson, Cowper, and
Wordsworth, with the cottagers around him, or had divined the noble
qualities which are masked by a rustic exterior. His sympathies were
contracted, and strange to say there is not one word in his voluminous
writings on human kind which denotes that he had felt in the smallest
degree the loveliness of children. His main interest was in men and
women, whose names, for good or evil, were before the world, and in
speaking of them he dwelt principally upon their foibles and misdeeds.</p>

<p>The censure of Warton is valid when he complains that Pope's account of
field sports is deficient in characteristic details. He found a
stag-chase in Cooper's Hill, which determined him to extend, while ho
imitated, the plan of his original, and introduce hunting, fishing,
shooting, and netting into Windsor Forest, though he was not a
sportsman. The objection that his stag-chase is not as circumstantial as
that of Somerville, is fairly answered by Johnson's remark, that the
chase was the main subject of Somerville, and is only subsidiary with
Pope. More, nevertheless, was required than a description of the
impatience and galloping of the horses, and of the eagerness of the
riders. Of this single topic one half was a translation from Statius.
The fishing and shooting are superior to the hunt. The particulars are
meagre, but there is mastery in the mode of representing them. The dying
pheasant is painted in language as rich as its plumage, and the doves,
the lapwing, the lark, and the wintry landscape, could not have been
brought more vividly before the mind, or in fewer words. A gentle pathos
intermingles with the whole. The portrait of the angler would have been
perfect, in the single circumstance to which it is confined, if Pope had
not said of him, "he hopes the scaly breed." Wakefield observed that
"hope," used as an active verb, was intolerably affected, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> might
have extended the remark to the use of "scaly breed" for fish.</p>

<p>The "story part" of Windsor Forest is a mosaic of translated scraps from
Ovid's Metamorphoses. The fictions of heathen mythology, which had been
repeated to satiety, which exhibited no invention, and had no charm for
modern imaginations, are worse than an excrescence in the midst of
English prospects, sports, and history. The bad effect does not stop
with the puerilities themselves, but they communicate an air of weakness
and unreality to the general texture of the work.</p>

<p>The well-merited praise which Bowles bestowed upon "the historical part"
of the poem is inapplicable to the ill drawn character of William the
Conqueror. Pope saw in him only a devastator and a tyrant. He had not
caught a glimpse of the robust will, and masculine genius, which
conquered and consolidated a great country. The vigour, daring, and
sagacity which tempered the grosser traits in the mind of William are
suppressed, and the masterly warrior and statesman is reduced to an
inglorious spoiler of peasants, and hunter of deer. The advantages which
accrued to England from the conquest itself were unknown to Pope, who
fancied that its principal result was to destroy agriculture, and
impoverish the people. He was not aware that it introduced a more
advanced civilisation, imparted new energy to a backward stagnant
population, opened up to them a vista of grander views, and repaid
transitory suffering by vast and permanent benefits.</p>

<p>A fourth element in Windsor Forest is not noticed by Bowles. Pope
considered that the "reflections upon life and political institutions"
were the distinguishing excellence of Cooper's Hill. He emulated in this
respect his master's merits, surpassed him in polish of style, and fell
below him in strength of thought. Hunting the hare suggests to Pope this
poor and false conclusion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beasts urged by us their fellow beasts pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learn of man each other to undo.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How much more weighty is the sentiment expressed by Denham, when the
stag endeavours to take refuge in the herd:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i19">The herd, unkindly wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or chases him from thence, or from him flies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a declining statesman, left forlorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his friends' pity, and pursuers' scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shame remembers, while himself was one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the same herd, himself the same had done.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The terse satire upon Henry VIII. is a still better specimen of Denham's
moralisings. As he surveys the prospect round Cooper's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> Hill he is
reminded of the dissolution of the monasteries, by the sight of the
place where once stood a chapel which had shared the fate of its parent
abbey. This rouses his indignation, and he thus proceeds:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tell me, my Muse, what monstrous dire offence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What crime could any Christian king incense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such a rage? Was't luxury or lust?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was <i>he</i> so temperate, so chaste, so just?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were these their crimes?&mdash;they were his own much more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wealth is crime enough to him that's poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who having spent the treasures of his crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condemns their luxury to feed his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he the church at once protects and spoils:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But princes' swords are sharper than their styles.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last couplet is a contrast between the destroying energy of Henry
VIII., and the impotence of his book against Luther.</p>

<p>Windsor Forest has rather more variety in its versification than is
usual with Pope. The poem opens with one of those breaks in the metre
which were incessant in the older rhymsters, and which were gradually
abjured by their successors.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy forest, Windsor! and thy green retreats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the monarch's and the muse's seats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invite my lays.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This use of the full stop commonly required that the sense should be
carried on without a pause from the preceding line, whereas the theory
spread that the close of the sense should coincide with the close of the
rhymed sound, or in other words that the full stop should be always at
the end of the couplet. To keep the rhyme predominant there was an
increasing tendency to have at least the pause of a comma, even after
the final word of the first line of the couplet. Thus from a license,
which, as Prior says, "was found too dissolute and wild, and came very
often too near prose," the writers of heroics arrived at a system which
"produced too frequent an identity in the sound, and brought every
couplet to the point of an epigram."<a name="FNanchor_34_1069" id="FNanchor_34_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_1069" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Denham, according to Johnson,
was the chief reformer who "taught his followers the art of concluding
their sense in couplets,"<a name="FNanchor_35_1070" id="FNanchor_35_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_1070" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> but he retained much of the primitive
freedom, and Prior says that to Dryden belongs the credit of perfecting
the innovation, and the blame of pushing it to excess. Pope went further
than Dryden. When once the change had commenced there was a constant
movement towards uniformity till the utmost verge was reached, and a
fresh reaction began. Bowles, with his fine ear, was a zealous advocate
for diversified harmony, and tuneful strength.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> He felt that an
occasional break, managed with skill, adds dignity to the couplet, while
the toning down of the final syllables, by sometimes running one verse
into another, is a grateful antidote to the cloying monotony of emphatic
rhymes. Imperfect rhymes offend from the impression they give of
imperfect art, but perfect rhymes softened by the continuous flow of the
pronunciation, are a relief to the ear. As the rhymed sound should be
diminished at intervals, so, at intervals, it may be advantageously
increased by the introduction of triplets. Dryden often used them with
admirable effect;<a name="FNanchor_36_1071" id="FNanchor_36_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_1071" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Pope employed them sparingly, and they were almost
entirely laid aside by his immediate imitators. With them the taste for
numerous verse was extinct.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_1071" id="Footnote_36_1071"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_1071"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Dryden maintains, in his Dedication to the &AElig;neis, that the
triplet, conjoined with the Alexandrine, is "the <i>magna charta</i> of
heroic poetry." "Besides," he says, "the majesty which it gives, it
confines the sense within the barriers of three lines, which would
languish if it were lengthened into four." Johnson, while granting that
the variety arising from triplets was desirable, wished that there
should "be some stated mode of admitting them," in order to prevent
their coming upon the reader by surprise, and to keep up the constancy
of metrical laws. Such a rule would introduce a new species of monotony,
and do away with the benefit which principally recommended triplets to
Dryden. Ideas which were not enough for four lines, and over-much for
two, would not recur at stages fixed beforehand. Swift thought triplets
and Alexandrines "a corruption," and boasted that he had "banished them"
by a triplet in his City Shower. "I absolutely," he adds, "did prevail
with Mr. Pope, and Gay, and Dr. Young, and one or two more to reject
them. Mr. Pope never used them till he translated Homer, which was too
long a work to be so very exact in; and I think in one or two of his
last poems he has, out of laziness, done the same thing, though very
seldom." Swift was mistaken in his assertion that Pope never used
triplets till he translated the Iliad. They occur in the Essay on
Criticism, the Temple of Fame, and other pieces, and not only did these
works appear before the Homer, but they appeared after the triplet in
the City Shower, which Swift flattered himself had banished all triplets
from poetry. Nor had he any need to persuade Young and Gay to reject
them if they had been exploded by his triplet of 1710, for it was two or
three years later before either Young or Gray printed their first
rhymes. They contained, however, triplets in spite of his City Shower,
which had none of the effect he imagined. It merely proved, what no one
doubted, that a metre proper to serious subjects was ludicrous in a
burlesque. Swift's dislike to triplets and Alexandrines was a prejudice,
and he did not pretend to offer any reason for his decree.</p></div>

celebrated nobleman as a poet, by Dryden, by Addison, by Bolingbroke, by
our Author, and others, yet candid criticism must oblige us to confess,
that he was but a feeble imitator of the feeblest parts of Waller. After
having been secretary at war, 1710, controller and treasurer to the
household, and of her majesty's privy council, and created a peer, 1711,
he was seized as a suspected person, at the accession of George I., and
confined in the Tower. Whatever may be thought of Lord Lansdowne as a
poet, his character as a man was highly valuable. His conversation was
most pleasing and polite; his affability, and universal benevolence, and
gentleness, captivating; he was a firm friend and a sincere lover of his
country. This is the character I received of him from his near relation,
the late excellent Mrs. Delany.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span></p></div>

</p><p>
Thierry believes that the forest laws had a more serious object than to
secure for the king a monopoly of sport. The chief intention was to keep
the newly conquered Saxons from going armed under the pretext that they
were in pursuit of game. Hence the penalty was of a nature to
incapacitate the offender for military service.</p></div>

<p>
Wakefield remarks that there is an inaccuracy in Pope's couplet, since
the "savage laws" to which the pronoun "they" in part refers, were the
mode in which the severity of the king displayed itself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_1091" id="Footnote_20_1091"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_1091"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The representation is erroneous. The "air, floods, and
wilds" were not "dispeopled." The forest laws occasioned an increase in
the quantity of game, which was preserved more carefully when it became
the property of the privileged few, and was no longer liable to be
exterminated by the many. Pope is not consistent with himself, for he
afterwards complains that "while the subject starved the <i>beast</i> was
<i>fed</i>."</p></div>

The conceit is childish, because dens and caves are the residence of

the tyrannies exercised there by William I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span>
</p><p>
I have the authority of three or four of our best antiquarians to say,
that the common tradition of villages and parishes, within the compass
of thirty miles, being destroyed, in the New Forest, is absolutely
groundless, no traces or vestiges of such being to be discovered, nor
any other parish named in Doomsday Book, but what now remains.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton.</span>
</p><p>
The argument from Doomsday Book is of no weight if, as Lingard asserts,
the New Forest was formed before the registration took place. William
was an eager sportsman. "He loved the beasts of chase," says the Saxon
chronicle, "as if he had been their father," and the source of his love
was the pleasure he took in killing them. His hunting grounds, however,
were ample without the New Forest, and Thierry thinks that his motive in
forming it may have been political. The wooded district, denuded of a
hostile population, and stretching to the sea, would have afforded
shelter to the Normans in the event of a reverse, and enabled them to
disembark in safety.</p></div>

succumb to the strong. The statement that he was "awed by his nobles" is
opposed to the contemporary testimony of the Saxon chronicle. "No man,"
says the writer, "durst do anything against his will; he had earls in
his bonds who had done against his will, and at last he did not spare
his own brother, Odo; him he set in prison." "His rich men moaned," says
the chronicler again, "and the poor men murmured, but he was so hard
that he recked not the hatred of them all."</p></div>

was concerned," says Lingard, "William listened to no suggestions but
those of ambition or avarice, but on other occasions he displayed a
strong sense of religion, and a profound respect for its institutions."
While resisting ecclesiastical usurpation, and depriving individuals who
were disaffected or incompetent, of their preferment, he upheld the
church and its dignitaries, and left both in a more exalted position
than he found them.</p></div>

his body was about to be lowered into the vault in the church of St.

from his father, but the prelates having paid him sixty shillings on the

proceed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_72_1143" id="Footnote_72_1143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_1143"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> This use of the word "reign" for the territory ruled over,
instead of for the sway of the ruler, was always uncommon, and is now
obsolete. Queen Anne is mentioned in connection with the chase and the
"immortal huntress," because her favourite diversion before she grew
unwieldy and inactive, was to follow the hounds in her chaise.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73_1144" id="Footnote_73_1144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_1144"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> Better in the manuscript:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And rules the boundless empire of the main.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
By the alteration Pope increased the compliment to Anne by making her
the light of the earth as well as mistress of the forest and the sea.
Wakefield thinks that this application to the queen of the offices of
Diana as goddess of the woods, the luminary of the night, and the chief
agent in the production of the tides, is happily conceived, but the moon
and the monarch were "the light of the earth "and "empress of the main"
in such different senses, that the line is a trivial play upon words.</p></div>

previous lines, with the variation of "sunny heaths" for "airy wastes,"
were printed in a note, and their place in the text was supplied by a
single couplet:

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here, as old bards have sung, Diana strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bathed in the springs, or sought the cooling shade.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Wakefield suggests that Pope rejected this latter line, as not being
suited to the prevailing character of the English climate, but at ver.
209 he represents the goddess as often "laving" in the Lodona, and to
bathe and luxuriate in shade are surely common enough in England.</p></div>

honours." Pope probably considered that "rear," which denoted an upward
direction, could not be consistently conjoined with "spreading." For
"shores," improperly applied in the next line to a river, all the
editions before 1736 had "banks."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_90_1161" id="Footnote_90_1161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_1161"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> "Her" appears for the first time in the edition of
Warburton in the place of "his," and is now the accepted reading, but it
is manifestly a misprint, since "her" has no antecedent. The couplet is
obscure. Pope could hardly intend to assert that the flow of the tide
poured as much water into the Thames as all the other rivers of the
world discharged into the ocean, and he probably meant that all the
navigable rivers of the globe did not send more commerce to the sea than
came from the sea up the Thames. Even in this case it was a wild,
without being a poetical, exaggeration.</p></div>

Pope told Spence that Cowley was killed by a fever brought on by lying
out all night in the fields. He had got drunk, in company with his
friend Dean Sprat, at the house of a neighbour, and they lost their way
in the attempt to walk home. Sprat had long before related that Cowley
caught his last illness in the "meadows," but says it was caused "by
staying too long amongst his labourers in the heat of the summer." The
drunkenness, and the lying out all night, appear to have been the

Pope says that "<i>each</i> muse" hung up her lyre because Cowley was thought

imitated from the Faery Queen. Pope professes to describe the river-gods

the description of rivers in Spenser, Drayton, and Milton. The
description is beautiful, but in some points it is deficient. "Winding
Isis" and "fruitful Thame" are ill designated. No peculiar and visible
image is added to the character of the streams, either interesting from
beauty, or incidental circumstances. Most rivers wind and may be called
fruitful, as well as the Isis and Thame. The latter part of the
description is much more masterly, as every river has its distinctive
mark, and that mark is picturesque. It may be said, however, that all
the epithets, in a description of this sort, cannot be equally
significant, but surely something more striking should have been given
as circumstantially characteristic of such rivers as the Isis and
Thames, than that they were "winding" and "fruitful," or of the Kennet
that it was renowned for "silver eels."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowles.</span></p></div>

<p>
The Mole at particular spots, called the swallows, sinks through
crevices in the chalk, and during dry seasons, when there is not
sufficient water to till both the subterranean and the upper channel,
the bed of the river is laid bare in parts of its course. The stream
sometimes entirely disappears from Burford-bridge to the neighbourhood
of Thorncroft-bridge, a distance of nearly three miles.</p></div>

Homer denominates the Nile, whose sources were unknown, a river that

<p>
Towards the close of 1712 Tickell published his poem on the Prospect of
Peace. "The description," Pope wrote to Caryll, "of the several parts of
the world in regard to our trade has interfered with some lines of my
own in Windsor Forest, though written before I saw his. I transcribe
both, and desire your sincere judgment whether I ought not to strike out
mine, either as they seem too like his, or as they are inferior." The
close resemblance arose from their having copied a common original. The
couplet of Pope on the West India islands, which he subsequently
omitted, has no counterpart in Tickell, because it was not derived from
the passage in Addison.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_175_1246" id="Footnote_175_1246"></a><a href="#FNanchor_175_1246"><span class="label">[175]</span></a> In poetical philosophy the crude material from which
jewels and the precious metals were formed, was supposed to be ripened
into maturity by the sun. Tickell has the same idea:

surprise, whether the surprise was coupled with commendation or censure,
or was simply a sentiment of wonder. Thus Milton, using the word in this
last sense, says, Par. Lost, i. 690:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">Let none admire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That riches grow in hell; that soil may best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserve the precious bane.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
"Admire" has the same signification in Windsor Forest. Pope means that
the savages would be astonished at "our speech, our colour, and our
strange attire," and not that they would admire them in our present
laudatory sense of the term, which would be contrary to the fact. "A
fair complexion," says Adam Smith, "is a shocking deformity upon the
coast of Guinea. Thick lips and a flat nose are a beauty."</p></div>

<span class="i0">Nor bring the secrets of the gods to light.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Pope says that he will not presume "to touch on Albion's golden days,"
and "bring the scenes of opening fate to light," oblivious that the
speech which Father Thames has just delivered is entirely made up of
these two topics. As might be inferred from their feebleness, the lines
from ver. 426 formed part of the original Windsor Forest, with the
exception of the couplet beginning "Where Peace descending," which is of
another order of poetry. The second line is exquisite.</p></div>

the compliment to Lord Lansdowne, from the conclusion of Addison's

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I've already troubled you too long,<br /></span>

the first line of his Pastorals, as Virgil closed his Georgics with the
first line of his Eclogues. The preceding couplet scarcely rises to
mediocrity, and seems modelled from Dryden's version of the passage
imitated:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
